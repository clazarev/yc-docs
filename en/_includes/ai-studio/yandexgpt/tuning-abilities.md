You cannot fine-tune a text generation model based on new data, e.g., the knowledge base of your support service. However, you can train the model to generate responses in a specific format or analyze texts. You can train the model to:
* Summarize and rewrite texts.
* Generate questions and answers from text input.
* Provide responses in a particular format or style.
* Classify texts, queries, and conversations.
* Extract entities from texts.
* Fine-tune classification and embedding models.
