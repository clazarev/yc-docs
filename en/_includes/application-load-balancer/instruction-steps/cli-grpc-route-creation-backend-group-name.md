`--backend-group-name`: Name of the [backend group](../../../application-load-balancer/concepts/backend-group.md) located in the same folder as the [HTTP router](../../../application-load-balancer/concepts/http-router.md) and virtual host for which you are creating the new route.

Instead of the backend group name, you can provide its ID in the `--backend-group-id` parameter.
