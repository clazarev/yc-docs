`--disable-security-profile`: Parameter that disables the use of the virtual hostâ€™s [{{ sws-full-name }}](../../../smartwebsecurity/index.yaml) [profile](../../../smartwebsecurity/concepts/profiles.md) for the route. A security profile allows you to filter incoming requests, enable [WAF](../../../smartwebsecurity/concepts/waf.md), and set limits on the number of requests for protection against malicious activity. For more information, see [{#T}](../../../smartwebsecurity/concepts/profiles.md). This is an optional parameter. By default, the security profile associated with a virtual host applies to all routes you create.
