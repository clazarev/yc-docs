* Optionally, enable **{{ ui-key.yacloud.backup.policy-form.field_run-later }}** to run all skipped backup jobs after the VM starts if the VM was `Stopped` during the scheduled backup. This is only supported for incremental backups.
* Optionally, enable **{{ ui-key.yacloud.backup.policy-overview.field_fast-copy }}** to speed up creating incremental backups. Changes in the file will be determined by size, date, and last update time. If the option is disabled, {{ backup-name }} will compare the contents of all files with the backup contents. This option does not work for volumes with JFS, ReiserFS3, ReiserFS4, ReFS, or XFS file systems.
* Optionally, enable **{{ ui-key.yacloud.backup.policy-form.field_sector-by-sector }}** to create an exact copy of a disk or volume at the physical level. It creates a backup of all sectors of a disk or volume, including empty areas and unallocated space. If no compression level is selected, the backup size will be equal to the disk size. This mode is used automatically for disks with unsupported file systems. You cannot restore application data from such a backup.
* Optionally, enable **{{ ui-key.yacloud.backup.policy-form.field_validation-enabled }}** to make sure you will be able to restore data from the created backup. During a check, a checksum is calculated for each section available for recovery. The check may take a long time because it scans all recoverable data.
