      If this is your first {{ yandex-cloud }} billing account, you are eligible for a [trial period](../../billing/concepts/trial-period.md). After it expires, the access to your resources will be suspended. To resume operation, you will need to switch to the [paid version](../../billing/operations/activate-commercial.md).
