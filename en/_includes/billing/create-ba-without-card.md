{% note warning %}

You may skip adding a card in the billing account creation form as this step is optional. However, in this case, you will not be eligible for the [initial grant](../../billing/concepts/bonus-account.md), even if you add a card later. You will be able to work with paid resources in the cloud only after you [top up your personal account](../../billing/operations/pay-the-bill.md).
