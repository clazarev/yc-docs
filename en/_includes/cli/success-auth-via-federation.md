On successful authentication, the [IAM token](../../iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token.md) is saved in the profile. This IAM token is used to authenticate each operation until the [token expires](../../iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token.md). After that, the CLI again displays a prompt to authenticate in the browser.
