Read and write operations utilize the same disk resource. The more read operations you do, the fewer write operations you can do, and vice versa. For more information, see [{#T}](../compute/concepts/storage-read-write.md).

^4^ For maximum IOPS, we recommend keeping your read and write operations close to the disk block size (4 KB by default).

^5^ For maximum bandwidth, we recommend 4 MB reads and writes.

Time to complete processes when stopping a VM^6^ | 30 seconds

^6^ When a VM stops, the hypervisor sends a shutdown signal to the VM operating system. The OS has 30 seconds to gracefully terminate all running processes to avoid data loss. After this time elapses, the VM will be forcibly terminated.
