You can limit data export from charts based on this connection. To do this, click ![icon](../../../_assets/console-icons/gear.svg) at the top right and uncheck **Allow data export**. With this option disabled, the charts will no longer display the export data option in their ![icon](../../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) menu. However, you will still be able to copy chart data and take screenshots.
