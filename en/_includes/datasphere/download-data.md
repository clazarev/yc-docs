You can upload small data amounts (up to 100 MB) to your {{ ml-platform-name }} project through the {{ jlab }}Lab interface. For larger amounts of data, we recommend loading from network storage or databases. To handle large data amounts, you can also use [datasets](../../datasphere/concepts/dataset.md).

To upload data to your project via the {{ jlab }}Lab interface:

1. Under ![folder](../../_assets/datasphere/jupyterlab/folder.svg) **File Browser**, select the folder for uploading data.
1. At the top left, click ![upload](../../_assets/datasphere/jupyterlab/upload.svg).
1. Select the files to upload.

Learn more about project storage [here](../../datasphere/concepts/project.md#storage).

{{ ml-platform-name }} allows you to upload data from different sources:

* [{#T}](../../datasphere/operations/data/connect-to-s3.md)
* [{#T}](../../datasphere/operations/data/connect-to-google-drive.md)
* [{#T}](../../datasphere/operations/data/connect-to-clickhouse.md)
