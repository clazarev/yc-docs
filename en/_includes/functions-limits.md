#### Limits {#functions-limits}

Type of limit | Value
--- | ---
**Maximum uploaded file size** |
ZIP archive from the management console | 3.5 MB
ZIP archive from S3 bucket | 128 MB
Unzipped ZIP archive from S3 bucket | 680 MB
**Other restrictions** |
Maximum size of the JSON structure of a [request](../functions/concepts/function-invoke.md#request) and [response](../functions/concepts/function-invoke.md#response) | 3.5 MB
Maximum size of [temporary files](../functions/concepts/runtime/environment-variables.md#files) | 512 MB
Maximum function execution time before [timeout](../functions/operations/function/version-manage.md), including first call initialization^1^ | 1 hour
Maximum RAM per function instance | 8 GB
Maximum total environment variable storage, including variable names^2^ | 4 KB
Maximum number of triggers per [message queue](../message-queue/concepts/queue.md) | 1
Maximum message size per trigger^3^ | 230 KB
Number of network packets per second per function instance | 10,000 

^1^ A timeout longer than ten minutes is only available for [long-lived functions](../functions/concepts/long-lived-functions.md).
^2^ {{ lockbox-short-name }} secrets are provided via environment variables and are also counted towards this limit.
^3^ The message may include service metadata, which will reduce the maximum message size.


#### Other restrictions {#functions-other-restrictions}

When installing dependencies:
  * The total time for installing dependencies is limited to **five minutes**. After it expires, the build will fail with an error.
  * For dependency installation, **1 GB** of RAM is allocated, of which **700 MB** is allocated for temporary file storage (tmpfs). Memory is consumed by active processes and files created and downloaded during the build.
  * **50%** of the CPU is available.

  If the build takes longer than five minutes or requires more resources, build the dependencies yourself and [download the function as a ZIP archive](../functions/operations/function/version-manage.md).
