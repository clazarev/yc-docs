At the Preview stage, you can send [push notifications](../../notifications/concepts/push.md) to iOS and Android devices, browsers, and via [SMS](../../notifications/concepts/sms.md). Notifications can go both to individual endpoints and endpoint groups via [topics](../../notifications/concepts/topics.md).

Moving forward, we will be adding notifications to messengers.
