When designing an infrastructure, one should consider the quotas and limits the cloud resources are subject to. {{ quota-manager-name }} allows you to manage quotas of your {{ yandex-cloud }} services using different interfaces. Some services, such as {{ speechkit-name }} and {{ video-full-name }}, are not available in {{ quota-manager-name }}.

**Quotas** are limits on the amount of resources you can use in cloud. These are organizational limits that can be changed as needed. Quotas help you avoid overspending and excessive use of resources through sensible budget planning and consumption management.

The two concepts in quota management are:

* **Quota limit** or just **quota**: Current limit in place for a resource for a cloud or organization.

* **Quota usage**: Amount or size of the actually used resource.
