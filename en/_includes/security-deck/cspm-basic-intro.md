[Cloud Security Posture Management ({{ cspm-name }})](../../security-deck/concepts/cspm.md) is a tool that monitors infrastructure security level based on security standards, such as [{{ yandex-cloud }}'s Cloud Infrastructure Security Standard](../../security/standard/all.md).

In a given [workspace](../../security-deck/concepts/workspace.md), Cloud Security Posture Management ({{ cspm-name }}) checks the cloud infrastructure and applications deployed on the {{ yandex-cloud }} platform for compliance with comprehensive security requirements and best practices. The module's [rules](../../security-deck/concepts/cspm.md#rules) and [exceptions](../../security-deck/concepts/cspm.md#exceptions) help ensure compliance with security policies and protection against common threats and vulnerabilities in the cloud environment.
