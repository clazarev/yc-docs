For each security rule violation, an [alert](../../security-deck/concepts/alerts.md) is created with a detailed description of the violation, severity, detection time, list of affected resources and troubleshooting recommendations.

You can manage troubleshooting for each specific alert:
* Assign persons responsible for troubleshooting.
* Manage the alert status.
* Leave comments.
* Keep track of troubleshooting progress.
* Request analysis from the [AI assistant](../../security-deck/concepts/ai-assistant.md).
