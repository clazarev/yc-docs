* ![cspm-standard-k8s-restricted](../../_assets/security-deck/cspm-standard-k8s-restricted.svg) `{{ k8s }} Pod Security Standards (Restricted)`: This standard contains security controls based on the [{{ k8s }} Pod Security Standards (PSS) Restricted profile](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted). A restricted profile is the most secure and provides the highest detection efficiency for container-based attacks. It applies strict security policies that may require modifying applications to ensure compliance. A restricted profile is recommended for security-critical applications and environments where maximum security is required.
* ![cspm-standard-k8s-baseline](../../_assets/security-deck/cspm-standard-k8s-baseline.svg) `{{ k8s }} Pod Security Standards (Baseline)`: This standard contains security controls based on the [{{ k8s }} Pod Security Standards (PSS) Baseline profile](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#baseline). A baseline profile is designed for easy implementation and provides common best practices for container security. It prevents the most common security issues in containers while maintaining compatibility with most applications. The baseline profile is a good starting point for organizations just getting started with container security.
* ![cspm-standard-k8s-ms](../../_assets/security-deck/cspm-standard-k8s-ms.svg) `Microsoft Threat Matrix for {{ k8s }}`: This standard contains security controls based on the [Microsoft Threat Matrix for {{ k8s }}](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2020/04/02/attack-matrix-kubernetes/), which is a framework that helps security teams understand and fend off threats specific to {{ k8s }} environments. It provides a comprehensive approach to attack methods and defensive strategies tailored for container orchestration platforms.
