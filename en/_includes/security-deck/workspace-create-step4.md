Optionally, in the **{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.security.workspaces.WorkspaceOnboardingForm.participantsTitle_1WfGq }}** section that opens, add users who will have access to the workspace being created and assign them roles in this workspace:

1. Click ![person-plus](../../_assets/console-icons/person-plus.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.security.workspaces.WorkspaceParticipantsForm.action_add-user }}** and in the window that opens:

    {% include [workspace-create-step4-adding-user-substep](./workspace-create-step4-adding-user-substep.md) %}

1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.security.workspaces.WorkspaceOnboardingForm.finishOnboarding }}** to complete creating the {{ sd-name }} workspace.

You do not have to add additional users to the workspace. In this case, the workspace will only be available to its creator.
