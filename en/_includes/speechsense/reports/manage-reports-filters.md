Optionally, if you want the report to include dialogs with specific properties, do the following:

   1. Click ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/plus.svg) next to the **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.common.period }}** field.

   1. In the drop-down list, select a dialog property, e.g., `Agent` or `Product`.

   1. Depending on the selected property, enter its values, comma-separated, or specify a range of values.

   {% note tip %}

   To filter dialogs by semantic properties, such as topics or totals, [use a semantic attribute](#apply-sense-attribute) as the filter.

   {% endnote %}

   The report will only include dialogs which meet the filter conditions. To use multiple filters, apply them one after another. For more information, see [{#T}](../../../speechsense/concepts/reports/evaluation-form.md#filters).
