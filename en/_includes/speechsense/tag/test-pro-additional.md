At the first stage, the search selection comprises a maximum of 1,000 random dialogs of different probabilities (high, average, low). The higher the probability, the better the dialog matches the search query. The found dialogs are ranked based on their probability. At the second stage, the first ten dialogs with high probability are selected. For these dialogs, the Pro model is started. Once the testing is over, you get the applicability rating for the tag. To test the next ten dialogs, click **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.common.show-more }}**.
