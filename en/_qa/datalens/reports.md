### Does {{ datalens-short-name }} support selectors in reports? {#selector-in-report}

{{ datalens-short-name }} supports selectors in [reports](../../datalens/reports/index.md), which enables you to configure data filtering. You can add a regular [selector](../../datalens/dashboard/selector.md) or a [JS selector](../../datalens/charts/editor/widgets/controls.md) to a report. Before adding a selector, make sure you have the `{{ permission-write }}` or `{{ permission-admin }}` access to the report. For more information, see [{#T}](../../datalens/security/manage-access.md).


### Is there a report demo version? {#demo-report}

1. Click **Use** â†’ **Deploy**. By default, the workbook will be created in the root of [workbooks and collections](../../datalens/workbooks-collections/index.md). You can also select an existing collection or create a new one at this step.
