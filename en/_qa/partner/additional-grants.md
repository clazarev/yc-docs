# Partner program: Additional grants

#### What are additional grants for? {#additional-grants}

The program is aimed at helping partners launch their business of providing services to customers in {{ yandex-cloud }}. To facilitate the partner businesses, we provide grants. The program allows you to receive two types of fixed-term grants within the first six months of obtaining your partner status:

* Grant for your customer's pilot project.
* Grants under the partner support programs.

#### What is the grant for your customer's pilot project? {#pilot-grant}

Such a grant is credited to a customer subaccount.

{% note info %}

A subaccount is an additional account for a customer billing account. It is created automatically when you link your customer's account to your own on the partner portal. It is displayed both in your {{ yandex-cloud }} account's console and the customer's console.

{% endnote %}

#### How do I get a pilot grant for my customer's subaccount? {#get-pilot-grant}

Send a request to the support team with the following information:

* Customer's billing account.
* Brief description of your solution and what the pilot is designed for.
* Pilot project timelines.
* List of required services.
* Requested grant amount (in RUB).
* Customer's subaccount linked to your account.

We will review your request and notify you whether you are eligible for the grant and let you know its terms (amount, validity period, and when it will be credited).
