# Agreements and accounts

#### How is the relationship between partners and {{ yandex-cloud }} regulated? {#offer}

The relationship between a partner and {{ yandex-cloud }} is governed by the [Partner Agreement](https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_partnership/?lang=ru) that you sign when applying to participate in the [partner program](/partners/service#join). The Partner Agreement is a separate agreement that supplements the {{ yandex-cloud }} Offer Agreement in terms of participation in the partner program.

You enter into an agreement with a customer yourself.


#### Where can I get sample agreements? {#examples-of-contracts}

You can use your own agreement template or the examples we provide you with in the [Partner Kit](../../partner/program/var-tools.md#kit), namely:

* Simple agreements for providing services without an agent fee. These agreements allow you to include both the cost of using {{ yandex-cloud }} services and that of support and maintenance services for you as a partner company.
* Commission agreements which, as some experts believe, are more consistent with the subject of agreements for _services to provide access to cloud resources_ in terms of their wording for taxation purposes.

#### What is an agent's tax base: the entire amount paid by a customer under the payment invoice issued or only a partner bonus? {#tax-base}

If you use the Simplified Tax System (Russian: USN) and work under an agency agreement, you must specify an agent fee in a separate line in the agreement with the customer. In this case, you only pay taxes on the amount of the agent fee.

#### How is VAT refunded if I use the Simplified Tax System (USN)? {#VAT}

If your customer pays VAT, you can re-issue invoices from your organization to them. However, you will still have to maintain the balance sheet and the invoice register and submit those to the tax service.


#### How is payment handled in {{ yandex-cloud }} for partners? What will happen if my account balance reaches zero? {#payments}

{{ yandex-cloud }} uses a postpaid billing system. To get started, you should switch to paid consumption mode. Your account or [subaccounts](../../partner/terms.md#sub-account) may start consuming resources without any deposit, right after activation. The amount for consumption across all subaccounts linked to the partner account is debited from the personal partner account.

At the end of each month, we will email you a service report that will show you the amount (excluding the partner bonus for the past / reporting month).

At the end of the reporting month, starting from the second month of paid consumption, you have 15 days to settle the payment invoice you receive. During this period and until you deposit funds on your account, your [credit limit](../../billing/concepts/billing-threshold.md) is activated. This credit limit is calculated automatically based on the average monthly consumption over the past few months.

If you do not settle the payment before the end of the current month or the credit limit is exceeded, we will contact you to clarify the reasons for the delay in payment and agree on the deadline for depositing the funds. If we fail to receive your response after several attempts to contact you, your resources may be suspended until the issue is resolved. For more information about suspending and restoring access to our services, see **Billing cycle** in the {{ billing-name }} documentation:

* [Individuals](../../billing/payment/billing-cycle-individual.md)
* [Businesses and individual entrepreneurs](../../billing/payment/billing-cycle-business.md)

#### At what point should a partner issue an invoice a customer for cloud consumption? {#client-invoice}

Partners can issue payment invoices to their customers at any time. We only monitor the settlement of payment invoices [between {{ yandex-cloud }} and partners](#payments). By accepting the offer, a partner commits to and accepts the rules for settling payment invoices under their account and subaccounts linked to it.
