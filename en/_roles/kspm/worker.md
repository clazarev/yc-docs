The `kspm.worker` role allows the user to view info on Managed Service for Kubernetes [clusters](../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/index.md#kubernetes-cluster) and install [KSPM](../../security-deck/concepts/kspm.md) components in them.

The role is issued to the [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) to perform cluster checks and extends to an organization, cloud, or folder. This service account should be specified when [creating](../../security-deck/operations/workspaces/create.md) the workspace.
