# Migrating to {{ cdn-full-name }} from a third-party CDN provider

If your dynamic website uses a third-party CDN to deliver static content to users, you can seamlessly migrate to {{ cdn-full-name }}. This tutorial explains how to migrate while keeping your content accessible at all times.

## Solution architecture {#solution-overview}

![cdn-migration-tutorial](../../_assets/cdn/cdn-migration-tutorial.svg)

To migrate smoothly, create a new [CDN resource](../../cdn/concepts/resource.md) in {{ cdn-full-name }} that uses the same [origin](../../cdn/concepts/origins.md) as the third-party CDN. Register a new subdomain for the new CDN resource and create a new [TLS certificate](../../certificate-manager/concepts/managed-certificate.md) for the second-level domain and all its third-level subdomains in {{ certificate-manager-full-name }}.

Once you have made sure the new CDN resource is working properly, update the static content links on your dynamic website accordingly. Then, remove the third-party CDN and add its domain name as an additional one to your {{ cdn-full-name }} resource.

Your dynamic website’s static content will stay continuously accessible as you migrate from a third-party CDN to {{ cdn-name }}.

To migrate a CDN resource to {{ cdn-full-name }}:

1. [Get your cloud ready](#before-you-begin).
1. [Add a TLS certificate to {{ certificate-manager-full-name }}](#issue-certificate).
1. [Create a CDN resource in {{ cdn-name }}](#setup-resource).
1. [Create a CNAME record for your new CDN resource's subdomain](#setup-subdomain).
1. [Update your website to use the new CDN resource](#update-website).
1. [Add an additional domain to the CDN resource in {{ cdn-name }}](#add-secondary-domain).

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}

### Access to DNS settings {#dns-access}

Make sure you can access the DNS settings on your DNS hosting provider’s website. This is usually the company that registered your domain.

Your DNS provider's dashboard should already include a public domain zone matching your domain name, e.g., `example.com.`. This zone should contain a [CNAME record](../../dns/concepts/resource-record.md#cname) for your current CDN subdomain, e.g., `cdn.example.com`, pointing to the third-party CDN provider.

### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The cost of the CDN infrastructure support includes fees for outbound traffic from CDN servers (see [{{ cdn-name }} pricing](../../cdn/pricing.md)).

## Add a TLS certificate to {{ certificate-manager-full-name }} {#issue-certificate}

To ensure data encryption when accessing the new CDN resource, add a new [TLS certificate](../../certificate-manager/concepts/managed-certificate.md) issued by Let's Encrypt® for your website's domain and all its subdomains (wildcard certificate) to {{ certificate-manager-full-name }}:

1. Create a new TLS certificate:

    {% list tabs group=instructions %}

    - Management console {#console}

      1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) to add a certificate to.
      1. From the list of services, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_certificate-manager }}**.
      1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.certificate-manager.button_empty-action }}** and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.certificate-manager.action_request }}**.
      1. In the window that opens, enter a name for your certificate in the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.certificate-manager.metadata.field_name }}** field, e.g., `my-cdn-certificate`.
      1. In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.certificate-manager.request.field_domains }}** field, specify the wildcard for your domain and its subdomains, e.g., `*.example.com`, where `example.com` is your website’s domain name.
      1. In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.certificate-manager.request.field_challenge-type }}** field, select `{{ ui-key.yacloud.certificate-manager.request.challenge-type_label_dns }}`.
      1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.certificate-manager.request.button_request }}**.

    - CLI {#cli}

      1. Request a new wildcard certificate. To do this, run the following command:

          ```bash
          yc certificate-manager certificate request \
            --name my-cdn-certificate \
            --domains "*.<your_website_domain_name>"
          ```

          Where:
          * `--name`: Certificate name, e.g., `my-cdn-certificate`.
          * `--domains`: Wildcard for your domain and its subdomains, e.g., `*.example.com`, where `example.com` is your website’s domain name.

          Result:

          ```text
          id: fpqba7lpgmp7********
          folder_id: b1gt6g8ht345********
          created_at: "2025-02-09T20:41:05.916923798Z"
          name: my-cdn-certificate
          type: MANAGED
          domains:
            - '*.example.com'
          status: VALIDATING
          updated_at: "2025-02-09T20:41:05.916923798Z"
          ```

          Save the certificate ID (from the `id` field), as you will need it in the next steps.

          For more information about the `yc certificate-manager certificate request` command, see the [CLI reference](../../cli/cli-ref/certificate-manager/cli-ref/certificate/request.md).

    {% endlist %}
1. Follow these steps to verify ownership of your domain:

    {% list tabs group=instructions %}

    - Management console {#console}

      1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) to which you added the [certificate](../../certificate-manager/concepts/managed-certificate.md).
      1. From the list of services, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_certificate-manager }}**.
      1. From the list of certificates, select the one you need verified.
      1. In the window that opens, under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.certificate-manager.overview.section_challenges }}**, you will see the details required to pass the domain rights check.

          In the **CNAME record** tab, copy and save the values of the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.certificate-manager.overview.challenge_label_dns-name }}** and **{{ ui-key.yacloud.certificate-manager.overview.challenge_label_value }}** fields. You will need these to create a CNAME record.

    - CLI {#cli}

      1. Retrieve the CNAME record values required for the domain rights check. To do this, run the following command while specifying the certificate ID you saved earlier.

          ```bash
          yc certificate-manager certificate get <certificate_ID> \
            --full \
            --format=json | \
            jq -r ".challenges[].dns_challenge"
          ```

          Result:

          ```json
          {
            "name": "_acme-challenge.example.com.",
            "type": "CNAME",
            "value": "fpqba7lpgmp7********.cm.yandexcloud.net."
          }
          {
            "name": "_acme-challenge.example.com.",
            "type": "TXT",
            "value": "oRnpmIJau5SWFDYqKwwUJMn-61HHdulvqk7********"
          }
          ```

          Save the values of the `name` and `value` fields for the `CNAME` record. You will need these to create a CNAME record.

          For more information about the `yc certificate-manager certificate get` command, see the [CLI reference](../../cli/cli-ref/certificate-manager/cli-ref/certificate/get.md).

    {% endlist %}
1. Using the values from the previous step, create a CNAME record in your website's public DNS zone to verify your domain ownership:

    If you delegated your website domain to {{ dns-full-name }}, follow [this tutorial](../../dns/operations/resource-record-create.md) to create a CNAME record. Otherwise, use your DNS provider's guides or contact their support.

    {% note info %}

    {% include [checking-domain-rights-cname](../../_includes/certificate-manager/checking-domain-rights-cname.md) %}

    {% endnote %}

Wait for the domain rights check to complete successfully. The wildcard certificate will then be issued and get the `Issued` status.

You can check the certificate status on the certificate page in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) or by running the `yc certificate-manager certificate get <certificate_ID>` CLI command.

## Create a CDN resource in {{ cdn-name }} {#setup-resource}

This section explains how to create a CDN resource with the `{{ ui-key.yacloud.cdn.value_source-type-url }}` origin type. If your origin is a {{ objstorage-full-name }} [bucket](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md) or a [{{ alb-full-name }}](../../application-load-balancer/concepts/application-load-balancer.md), use [this guide](../../cdn/operations/resources/create-resource.md) to create a CDN resource.

Create a CDN resource in {{ cdn-full-name }}:

        --origin-protocol '<origin_protocol>' \
        --cert-manager-ssl-cert-id <certificate_ID>
      ```

      Where:
      * `<subdomain_name>`: Domain name for which you created a CNAME record earlier and that the new CDN resource will use, e.g., `cdn-new.example.com`.
      * `--origin-custom-source`: Domain name or public IP address of your static content origin.
      * `--origin-protocol`: Protocol the CDN resource will use to communicate with the origin. The possible values are:

          * `http`: Use HTTP.
          * `https`: Use HTTPS.
          * `match`: Use the same value as that of the `Host` header in the client request to the CDN.

          If you select `https` or `match`, make sure your origin supports HTTPS.
      * `--cert-manager-ssl-cert-id`: TLS certificate ID saved earlier when creating the certificate.

{% note warning %}

After the CDN resource is set up, it may take up to 15 minutes for it to go live.

Make sure the new CDN resource is working properly before proceeding with the next steps.

{% endnote %}

## Create a CNAME record for your new CDN resource's subdomain {#setup-subdomain}

To seamlessly switch your website to the new CDN resource, you will need a new CDN subdomain. In your website's public DNS zone, create a CNAME record for the new CDN subdomain that the new CDN resource will use:

* Record name: New CDN subdomain name, e.g., `cdn-new.example.com.`.
* Record type: `CNAME`.
* Record value: `cname` value for the new CDN resource, available in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) on the CDN resource page (e.g., `{{ cname-example-yc }}`).

If you [delegated your website domain to {{ dns-full-name }}](../../dns/concepts/dns-zone.md#public-zones), follow [this guide](../../dns/operations/resource-record-create.md) to create a CNAME record. Otherwise, use your DNS provider's guides or contact their support.

## Update your website to use the new CDN resource {#update-website}

Once you have created a new CDN resource in {{ cdn-name }} and tested it, you can start updating your website configuration and removing the old CDN resource.

### Redirect links from the dynamic website {#redirect-links}

Redirect the static content links your dynamic website generates to the new CDN subdomain, e.g., by replacing `cdn.example.com` with `cdn-new.example.com`. It is your dynamic website's admin who must do this.

Once you have made all required changes, make sure the static content links your website generates are valid and the content is accessible. Also, make sure outbound traffic has stopped on the old CDN resource by using the statistics and monitoring tools from your third-party CDN provider.

Your dynamic website has now fully switched to {{ cdn-full-name }}.

### Update the CNAME record for the original CDN subdomain {#update-cname}

To keep your website's original CDN subdomain working with the new {{ cdn-name }} resource, replace the value of the resource CNAME record for the original subdomain with the one you got earlier:

* Record name: Original CDN subdomain name, e.g., `cdn.example.com.`.
* Record type: `CNAME`.
* Record value: `cname` value for the new CDN resource, available in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) on the CDN resource page (e.g., `{{ cname-example-yc }}`).

If you delegated your website’s domain to {{ dns-full-name }}, follow [this tutorial](../../dns/operations/resource-record-update.md) to update the CNAME record. Otherwise, use your DNS provider's guides or contact their support.

### Delete the third-party CDN {#delete-resource}

Once you have confirmed the original CDN resource from your third-party CDN provider is no longer sending outbound traffic, delete it. To do this, use the third-party DNS provider's guides or contact their support.

## Add an additional domain to the CDN resource in {{ cdn-name }} {#add-secondary-domain}

Once you have deleted the third-party CDN resource that was using the original CDN subdomain, you can add that subdomain as an additional domain to your new {{ cdn-name }} resource. To do this:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder with your CDN resource.
  1. From the list of services, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_cdn }}**.
  1. In the line with the CDN resource you created earlier, click ![ellipsis](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) and select ![pencil](../../_assets/console-icons/pencil.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.edit }}**.
  1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.cdn.label_section-domain }}**, click ![plus](../../_assets/console-icons/plus.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.cdn.button_add-domain }}** and then, in the field that appears, enter the domain name the old CDN resource used, e.g., `cdn.example.com`.
  1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.save }}**.

- {{ yandex-cloud }} CLI {#cli}

  1. Run this command:
  
      ```bash
      yc cdn resource update <CDN_resource_ID> \
        --secondary-hostnames '<old_CDN_subdomain>'
      ```

      Where:
      * `<CDN_resource_ID>`: {{ cdn-name }} resource ID you saved [earlier](#setup-resource).
      * `--secondary-hostnames`: Domain name that became available after deleting the third-party CDN resource, e.g., `cdn.example.com`.

      {% note warning %}

      This command will delete all additional domains previously linked to the CDN resource.
      
      To link an additional domain to a CDN resource that already has additional domains linked, list the domains in the `--secondary-hostnames` parameter while separating them with commas.
