# Establishing network connectivity between {{ baremetal-full-name }} subnets and on-premise environment with {{ interconnect-name }}

In this tutorial, you will set up network connectivity between a {{ baremetal-name }} [server](../../baremetal/concepts/servers.md) located in a [private {{ baremetal-full-name }} subnet](../../baremetal/concepts/network.md#private-network) and your on-premise resources. Network connectivity will be established using [{{ interconnect-name }}](../../interconnect/index.yaml) and [{{ cr-name }}](../../cloud-router/index.yaml).


The diagram above shows network connectivity between the {{ baremetal-full-name }} segment resources and customerâ€™s remote on-premise resources connected to {{ yandex-cloud }} via {{ interconnect-name }}.

To establish network connectivity between these resources and the customer's virtual network, you need to add the relevant {{ vpc-name }} subnet IP prefixes to the routing instance. For more on configuring this type of network connectivity, see the [relevant documentation](../../cloud-router/tutorials/bm-vrf-and-vpc-interconnect.md). 

{% note info %}

It is assumed that the connectivity between on-premise and the {{ vpc-short-name }} network via {{ interconnect-name }} has already been established and is operational. 

{% endnote %}

To set up network connectivity between {{ baremetal-name }} private subnets and on-premise resources using {{ interconnect-name }}, do the following:

1. [Get your cloud ready](#before-you-begin).
1. [Create a cloud infrastructure](#setup-infrastructure).
1. [Create a routing instance](#create-routing-instance).
1. [Create a private connection](#create-private-connection).
1. [Check network connectivity](#check-connectivity).

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out).

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}


### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The cost of supporting an infrastructure for network connectivity between {{ baremetal-name }} and {{ vpc-short-name }} subnets includes:

* Fee for using the VM [public IP address](../../vpc/concepts/address.md#public-addresses) (see [{{ vpc-full-name }} pricing](../../vpc/pricing.md)).
* Fee for [VM](../../compute/concepts/vm.md) computing resources and disks (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* {{ baremetal-name }} server lease fee (see [{{ baremetal-full-name }} pricing](../../baremetal/pricing.md)).


## Create a cloud infrastructure {#setup-infrastructure}

Create the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure you will use to set up network connectivity.

To configure {{ interconnect-name }} in {{ baremetal-name }}, you will need a private routable [subnet](../../baremetal/concepts/network.md#private-subnet) and a [VRF segment](../../baremetal/concepts/network.md#vrf-segment) in {{ baremetal-name }}, a [cloud network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) with one or more {{ vpc-name }} [subnets](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet), as well as a routing instance with one or more [announced](../../interconnect/concepts/priv-con.md#prc-announce) prefixes of {{ vpc-short-name }} private subnets.

To check network connectivity, you will need a {{ baremetal-name }} server and a {{ compute-name }} VM.

### Create a VRF segment and a {{ baremetal-name }} private subnet {#setup-vrf}

Create a virtual network segment (VRF) and a private subnet in the `{{ region-id }}-m3` [server pool](../../baremetal/concepts/servers.md#server-pools):

      {% include [server-lease-access](../../_includes/baremetal/server-lease-access.md) %}

  1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.baremetal.title_section-server-info }}**, in the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.baremetal.field_name }}** field, enter the server name: `server-m3`.
  1. {% include [server-lease-step13](../../_includes/baremetal/instruction-steps/server-lease-step13.md) %}

{% endlist %}

{% note info %}

Server setup and OS installation may take up to 45 minutes. The server will have the `Provisioning` status during this time. After OS installation is complete, the server status will change to `Ready`.

{% endnote %}

## Create a routing instance {#create-routing-instance}

To set up network connectivity between {{ baremetal-name }} subnets and on-premise subnets, you need to create a `Routing Instance` resource. To create a `Routing Instance`, [contact]({{ link-console-support }}/tickets/create) support.

If your folder already has [{{ interconnect-name }}](../../interconnect/index.yaml) network connectivity (VPC-to-On-Prem) configured, you can either use the existing `Routing Instance` or request a new additional `Routing Instance` to be created for standalone network connectivity.

### Make sure you have a routing instance in your folder {#check-for-ri}

1. {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

    {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

1. {% include [check-for-routing-instance](../../_includes/baremetal/check-for-routing-instance.md) %}

1. If you already have a routing instance, you may skip the next step and [proceed](#create-private-connection) to creating a private connection.

    If you do not have a routing instance or you want to build additional dedicated network connectivity, request a new routing instance.

### Request a new routing instance {#request-ri}

{% include [request-routing-instance](../../_includes/baremetal/request-routing-instance.md) %}

## Create a private connection {#create-private-connection}

Once the routing instance has been created in your folder, create a [private {{ interconnect-name }} connection](../../baremetal/concepts/network.md#private-connection-to-vpc) in {{ baremetal-name }}:

{% include [create-private-connection](../../_includes/baremetal/create-private-connection.md) %}

## Test network connectivity {#check-connectivity}

As soon as the status of the new private connection changes to `Ready`, network connectivity between the {{ baremetal-name }} and {{ vpc-short-name }} subnets will be established, and you can start checking it.

A network connectivity check assumes that:
* The process of setting up a private connection to cloud networks has been successfully completed (the connection status is `Ready`).
* The local firewall on the {{ baremetal-name }} server allows [ICMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) traffic.
* The routing table in the {{ baremetal-name }} server OS contains a route to the CIRD of the subnet the VM resides in.
* The [security group](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) assigned to the VM [network interface](../../compute/concepts/network.md) allows ICMP traffic.

### Test network connectivity from the private {{ baremetal-name }} subnet to on-premise resources {#check-bms-to-onprem}

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where you created the infrastructure.
  1. In the list of services, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_baremetal }}**.
  1. Next to `server-m3`, click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.baremetal.label_kvm-console }}**.
  
      The KVM console terminal window will open, showing a login prompt:
      
      ```
      server-m3 login:
      ```

      If you do not see this prompt, try [restarting](../../baremetal/operations/servers/server-stop-and-start.md#restart) the server.

  1. In the KVM console terminal, specify `root` for the username and press **ENTER**.
  1. Paste the password generated when leasing the server in the password input line and press **ENTER**. Note that when typing or pasting a password in Linux, the characters you enter will not appear on the screen.

## How to delete the resources you created {#clear-out}

To stop paying for the resources you created:

1. [Delete](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-delete.md) the VM.
1. You cannot delete a {{ baremetal-name }} server. Instead, [cancel](../../baremetal/operations/servers/server-lease-cancel.md) the server lease renewal.
1. Delete the private connection if you no longer need it:

    {% list tabs group=instructions %}

    - Management console {#console} 
    
      1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where you created the infrastructure.
      1. In the list of services, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_baremetal }}**.
      1. In the left-hand panel, click ![icon](../../_assets/console-icons/vector-square.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.baremetal.label_networks }}** and select `my-vrf`.
      1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.baremetal.title_vrf-interconnect-section }}**, click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) and select ![CircleXmark](../../_assets/console-icons/circle-xmark.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.baremetal.action_delete-external-connection }}**.
      1. In the window that opens, confirm the deletion.

      The connection status will change to `Deleting`. Once all links are deleted, the connection will disappear from the list.
