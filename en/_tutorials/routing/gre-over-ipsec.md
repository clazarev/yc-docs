# Configuring a secure GRE tunnel over IPsec


For secure communication between remote resources and data transmission over public communication channels, e.g., the internet, you can use secure connection technologies, such as the [IPsec](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2401.txt) protocol. However, IPsec has significant limitations: it is only designed for IP packet transmission, does not support [multicast delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_multicast), and cannot be combined with other protocols within a single request.

To extend the capabilities of IPsec, you can configure [GRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_Routing_Encapsulation) over it. GRE encapsulates network packets in IP packets, enabling you to transmit any traffic over IPsec.

In this example, you will create a secure GRE-over-IPsec tunnel between two [Cisco CSR 1000v](https://yandex.cloud/en/marketplace/products/yc/cisco-csr) virtual routers hosted in different [virtual networks](../../vpc/concepts/network.md) and [availability zones](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) in {{ yandex-cloud }}. 

You will configure IPsec in NAT-T ([NAT Traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_traversal) mode, since {{ yandex-cloud }} employs [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation)), while GRE does not support using ports. This mode enables the translation of router IP addresses over NAT when using a GRE-over-IPsec tunnel. This makes the tunnel configuration in our example suitable for both the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure and remote resources placed behind the device that provides NAT. 

To set up a secure tunnel between two virtual routers:

1. [Get your cloud ready](#before-you-begin).
1. [Create an SSH key pair](#create-ssh-keys).
1. [Create folders](#create-folders).
1. [Create two VMs with a Cisco Cloud Services Router](#create-routers).
1. [Configure IPSec protocols](#ipsec-setup).
1. [Create tunnel interfaces](#create-interfaces).
1. [Configure routing](#setup-routers).
1. [Test the tunnel](#check-tunnel).

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out).

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}

### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

{% note alert %}

When using a Cisco CSR 1000v image without a license, the router throughput is limited to 100 Kbps. To remove this limitation, [install a license](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/csr1000/software/configuration/b_CSR1000v_Configuration_Guide/b_CSR1000v_Configuration_Guide_chapter_01000.html).

{% endnote %}

The infrastructure support costs include:

* Fee for disks and continuously running VMs (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* Fee for using an external IP address (see [{{ vpc-full-name }} pricing](../../vpc/pricing.md#prices-public-ip)).

## Create an SSH key pair {#create-ssh-keys}

{% include [vm-ssh-rsa-key](../../_includes/vm-ssh-rsa-key.md) %}

{% note warning %}

Save the private key in a secure location, as you will not be able to connect to the VM without it.

{% endnote %}

## Create folders {#create-folders}

To test tunneling between two different virtual networks, place {{ yandex-cloud }} resources in different folders. To create a new folder:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select a [cloud](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#cloud) and click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/plus.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.console-dashboard.button_action-create-folder }}** at the top right.
   1. Enter the [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) name: `site-d`.
   1. Add a folder description if required.
   1. Select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.cloud.folders-create.field_default-net }}**. 
   1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.cloud.folders-create.button_create }}**.

- CLI {#cli}

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   Create a folder:
   ```bash
   yc resource-manager folder create \
   --name site-d \
   --description "Folder for site-d"
   ```

- API {#api}

   To create a folder, use the [create](../../resource-manager/api-ref/Folder/create.md) REST API method for the [Folder](../../resource-manager/api-ref/Folder/index.md) resource or the [FolderService/Create](../../resource-manager/api-ref/grpc/Folder/create.md) gRPC API call.

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

   {% include [terraform-install](../../_includes/terraform-install.md) %}

   1. In the configuration file, define the parameters of the resources you want to create:

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_resourcemanager_folder" "folder1" {
         cloud_id    = "<cloud_ID>"
         name        = "site-d"
         description = "Folder for site-d"
      }
      ```

      For more information about the `yandex_resourcemanager_folder` settings, see [this {{ TF }} article]({{ tf-provider-resources-link }}/resourcemanager_folder).

   1. Make sure the configuration files are correct.

      1. In the command line, go to the folder where you created the configuration file.

      1. Check the configuration using this command:

         ```
         terraform validate
         ```
     
         If the configuration is correct, you will get this message:
     
         ```
         Success! The configuration is valid.
         ```

      1. Run this command:

         ```
         terraform plan
         ```

         If the configuration description is correct, the terminal will display a list of the resources being created and their settings. If the configuration contains any errors, {{ TF }} will point them out. 

   1. Deploy the cloud resources.

      1. If the configuration does not contain any errors, run this command:

         ```
         terraform apply
         ```

      1. Confirm the creation of the resources: in the terminal, type `yes` and press **Enter**.

      This will create the folder in the specified cloud. You can check the new folder and its settings using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) or this [CLI](../../cli/quickstart.md) command:

      ```
      yc resource-manager cloud list
      ```

{% endlist %}

Repeat these steps to create a second folder named `site-b`.

   1. Wait for the operating system to fully start up.
   1. To switch to privileged mode, run this command in the serial console:

      ```bash
      enable
      ```

   1. Enter configuration mode and set the host name for the router:

      ```bash
      conf t
      hostname cisco-router
      ```

      The router name at the beginning of the command line should change to `cisco-router`.

{% endlist %}

### Create a user with administrator privileges {#create-user}

Create a user with administrator privileges and password authentication disabled:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

   In the serial console, run this command:

   ```bash
   username test-user privilege 15
   ```

{% endlist %}

### Prepare the key {#split-ssh}

If your public SSH key is longer than 72 characters, split it into chunks of 72 characters each:

1. In your computer terminal, run this command:

   ```bash
   fold -bw 72 <public_key_file_path>
   ```

   This will output your public SSH key split into chunks of 72 characters each.

1. Save the key hash:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -E md5 -lf <public_key_file_path>
   ```


### Configure authentication using SSH keys {#enable-ssh}


{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

   1. In the serial console, enable VM access over SSH:

      ```bash
      conf t
      aaa new-model
         ip ssh server algorithm authentication publickey 
         ip ssh pubkey-chain
      ```

   1. Create a user named `test-user` and provide your public SSH key in the chunks into which you split it at the previous step:

      ```bash
         username test-user
            key-string
               <public_key_row>
               ...
               <public_key_row>
               exit
            exit
         exit
      exit
      ```

   1. Make sure the key has been added:

      ```bash
      show run | beg ip ssh
      ```
      Result:

      ```bash
      ip ssh pubkey-chain
        username test-user
         key-hash ssh-rsa <key_hash> <username_associated_with_this_key>
      !
      !
      ...
      ```

      Compare the SSH key hash on the router with the key hash on your computer.

   1. In the serial console, enter the password that enables privileged mode:

      ```bash
      cisco-router#configure terminal
      cisco-router(config)#enable secret <password>
      ```

{% endlist %}


### Check the SSH connection to the router {#test-ssh}

1. Log in to the router via SSH by running this command in your computer terminal:

   ```bash
   ssh -i <private_key_file_path> test-user@<router_public_IP_address> 
   ```

   If the configuration is correct, you will log in to the router as `test-user`. If these actions produce no connection, make sure the router configuration is correct in the serial console, i.e., check whether you ran the `aaa new-model` command, the key hashes are identical on your computer and the router, and password authorization is disabled for the test user. If still unable to locate the issue, repeat the previous steps. 
1. Switch to privileged mode. To do this, enter the `enable` command and your password. If the configuration is correct, you can proceed to configuring the router.

### Set up and configure a second VM with a Cisco Cloud Services Router {#create-second-vm}

1. In the `site-b` folder, create a VM named `cisco-router-b` by following the above steps. Select **{{ region-id }}-b** as its availability zone.
1. Set up the VM in the same way as the `cisco-router-d` VM.

## Configure the IPSec protocols {#ipsec-setup}

{% note warning %}

* The settings are the same on both VMs, except as specifically mentioned.
* You will configure the protocols in the terminal connected to the VM over SSH, in privileged mode. 

{% endnote %}

1. Configure the global parameters for [IKEv2](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKE):

   ```bash
   conf t
   crypto logging ikev2
   crypto ikev2 nat keepalive 900
   crypto ikev2 dpd 10 2 periodic
   ```

1. Configure an IKEv2 `proposal`:

   ```bash
   crypto ikev2 proposal MY_IKEV2_PROPOSAL
      encryption aes-cbc-256
      integrity sha256
      group 2
      exit
   ```

1. Configure an IKEv2 `policy`:

   ```bash
   crypto ikev2 policy MY_IKEV2_POLICY
      proposal MY_IKEV2_PROPOSAL
      exit
   ```

1. Set a secret key:

   {% list tabs %}

   - Cisco-router-d VM

     ```bash
     crypto ikev2 keyring MY_IKEV2_KEYRING
        peer SiteB
        address cisco-router-b
        pre-shared-key <secret_key>
        exit
     ```

   - Cisco-router-b VM

     ```bash
     crypto ikev2 keyring MY_IKEV2_KEYRING
        peer SiteA
        address cisco-router-d
        pre-shared-key <secret_key>
        exit
     ```

   {% endlist %}

   Where:
   * `<secret_key>`: Encryption key that is at least 16 characters long, e.g., `MySecretKey12345`. Use the same key on both VMs.

1. Create an IKEv2 profile:

   {% list tabs %}

   - Cisco-router-d VM

     ```bash
     crypto ikev2 profile MY_IKEV2_PROFILE
        match address local interface GigabitEthernet1
        match identity remote address cisco-router-b
        authentication remote pre-share
        authentication local pre-share
        keyring local MY_IKEV2_KEYRING
        lifetime 28800
        dpd 20 2 periodic
        exit
     ```

   - Cisco-router-b VM

     ```bash
     crypto ikev2 profile MY_IKEV2_PROFILE
        match address local interface GigabitEthernet1
        match identity remote address cisco-router-d
        authentication remote pre-share
        authentication local pre-share
        keyring local MY_IKEV2_KEYRING
        lifetime 28800
        dpd 20 2 periodic
        exit
     ```

   {% endlist %}

   {% note info %}

   For testing purposes, you can use the `0.0.0.0` template rather than IP addresses to provide access to any IP.
   You can also set up separate profiles for different peers.

   {% endnote %}

1. Add the IKEv2 profile to the IPsec profile:

   ```bash
   crypto ipsec transform-set ESP_AES128_SHA256 esp-aes esp-sha-hmac
      mode tunnel
      exit
   crypto ipsec profile MY_IPSEC_PROFILE
      set transform-set ESP_AES128_SHA256
      set ikev2-profile MY_IKEV2_PROFILE
      exit
   exit
   ```

## Create tunnel interfaces {#create-interfaces}

{% note warning %}

* The settings are the same on both VMs, except as specifically mentioned.
* You will configure the protocols in the terminal connected to the VM over SSH, in privileged mode.

   show ip int brief
   show ip bgp summary
   show ip bgp
   show ip route bgp
   ```

## How to delete the resources you created {#clear-out}

To stop paying for the resources you created:
* [Delete](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-delete.md) the VM.
* [Delete](../../vpc/operations/address-delete.md) the static public IP if you reserved one.
