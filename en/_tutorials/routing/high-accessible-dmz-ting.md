# Implementing a secure high-availability network infrastructure with a dedicated DMZ based on Smart-Soft NGFW

In this tutorial, we will deploy a secure network infrastructure based on [Smart-Soft Traffic Inspector Next Generation (TING)](https://www.smart-soft.ru/). The infrastructure is made up of segments, each containing single-purpose resources, isolated from other resources. For example, the [DMZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)) segment is reserved for public-facing applications, whereas the `mgmt` segment contains infrastructure management resources. Each segment will have its own cloud folder and a dedicated {{ vpc-short-name }} [cloud network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network). The segments communicate with each other via a [next-generation firewall (NGFW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next-generation_firewall) VM, which provides end-to-end protection and traffic control across the segments.

You can see the solution architecture in the diagram below.

![image](../../_assets/tutorials/high-accessible-dmz-ting.svg)

The solution comprises these main segments (folders):

* The **public** folder for internet-facing resources.
* The **mgmt** folder for cloud infrastructure management and internal resources. It includes two VMs for infrastructure protection and network segmentation into security zones (`fw-a` and `fw-b`) and a VM with [WireGuard VPN](https://www.wireguard.com/) configured for secure access to the management segment (`jump-vm`).
* **dmz** that enables you to publish open-access applications.

For more information, see the [project repository](https://github.com/yandex-cloud-examples/yc-dmz-with-high-available-ting-ngfw).

To deploy a secure high-availability network infrastructure with a dedicated DMZ based on Smart-Soft TING:

1. [Get your cloud ready](#prepare-cloud).
1. [Set up your environment](#prepare-environment).
1. [Deploy your resources](#create-resources).
1. [Configure the NGFW](#configure-ngfw).
1. [Enable the route switcher](#enable-route-switcher).
1. [Test the solution for performance and fault tolerance](#test-accessibility).
1. [Requirements for production deployment](#deployment-requirements).

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out).

### Next-Generation Firewall {#next-generation-firewall}

An NGFW is used for cloud network protection and segmentation with a dedicated DMZ for public-facing applications.

[{{ marketplace-full-name }}]({{ link-cloud-marketplace }}?categories=security) offers multiple NGFW solutions. This scenario uses the Smart-Soft Traffic Inspector Next Generation (TING) solution offering this functionality:

* Next generation firewall: protects the virtual network from unauthorized access from outside, provides NAT, port forwarding, and packet interception.
* Intrusion detection and prevention system: IDS/IPS recognizes sources of attacks and attacked devices based on specific network traffic signatures and effectively _cleans_ traffic.
* General purpose TCP/UDP proxy server: Nginx-based proxy server provides load balancing, web server header overriding, TCP and UDP traffic handling.
* Listed in the Russian Software Register, TING is certified by FSTEC of Russia for compliance with requirements for Safety Class 4 Type B firewalls, Safety Class 4 network-level intrusion detection systems, as well as Trust Level 4 information security requirements.

In this tutorial, Smart-Soft TING uses a basic firewall and NAT rule configuration.

## Configure the NGFW {#configure-ngfw}

This tutorial describes how to configure firewalls FW-A and FW-B with basic firewall and NAT rules required for performance and fault tolerance tests for the purposes of this guide but insufficient for [production deployment](#deployment-requirements).

### Connect to the management segment via a VPN {#connect-via-vpn}

After deploying the infrastructure, the `mgmt` folder will contain the `jump-vm` Ubuntu instance with the configured [WireGuard VPN](https://www.wireguard.com/) providing secure connection. Set up a VPN tunnel to `jump-vm` on your PC to access the `mgmt`, `dmz`, and `public` segment subnets.

You can also connect to the jump VM over SSH using the SSH key from `terraform output` and the username from the `vm_admin_username` variable.

To set up a VPN tunnel:

1. [Install](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) WireGuard on your PC.
1. Open WireGuard and click **Add Tunnel**.
1. In the dialog that opens, select the `jump-vm-wg.conf` file in the `yc-dmz-with-high-available-ting-ngfw` directory.
1. Click **Activate** to activate the tunnel.
1. Check network connectivity with the management server via the WireGuard VPN tunnel by running the following command in the terminal:
   
   ```bash
   ping 192.168.1.101
   ```

   {% note warning %}

   If the packets fail to reach the management server, make sure the `mgmt-jump-vm-sg` [security group](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) rules for incoming traffic have your PC external IP address specified correctly.

   {% endnote %}

### Configure the FW-A firewall {#configure-fw-a}

Connect to the FW-A management web interface at `https://192.168.1.10`. Admin credentials: login from the `fw_admin_username` variable value, password from the `terraform output fw-a_admin_password` output (without quotes).

#### Configure your network {#configure-fw-a-network}

1. In the **Summary** section of the left-hand menu, select **Password**. Enter the old password from the `terraform output fw-a_admin_password` output and set a new password.

1. In the **System** section of the left-hand menu, select **Settings** -> **General**. In the **Hostname** field, specify `fw-a`. In the **Time zone** field, select your time zone. Under **DNS servers**, enter `192.168.1.2` as the IP address of the cloud DNS server in the `mgmt` segment. Click **Save**.

1. In the left-hand menu, in the **Services** section, select **Network time** -> **General**. In the **Time servers** section, specify the addresses of NTP servers (see the [list of recommended NTP servers](../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/ntp.md)). Tick the checkbox next to the preferred server in the **Prefer** column. Click **Save**.

1. In the left-hand menu, in the **Interfaces** section, select **\[WAN\]**. In the **Description** field, specify `mgmt`. Click **Save**.

1. In the left-hand menu, in the **System** section, select **Routes** -> **Configuration**. Click `+` to add a route. In the **Network address** field, specify `192.168.2.0/24`. In the **Gateway** field, select `MGMT_DHCP - 192.168.1.1`. In the **Description** field, specify `route to mgmt-zone2`. Click **Save**. Click **Apply**.

1. After adding all the rules on the **Firewall: Rules: dmz** page, click **Apply**.

   {% note info %}

     The network packet is checked for compliance with the rules from the top down. You can reorder the rules in the list.

     If a network packet complies with a rule, the action specified in the rule is applied to the packet. If a rule is applied to a packet, the firewall stops processing the packet: this packet will no longer be checked against the remaining rules in the list.

     If a network packet fails to comply with any of the rules, the packet gets blocked (i.e., discarded without indication to the remote side).

   {% endnote %}

1. In the left-hand menu, in the **Firewall** section, select **NAT** -> **Port redirection**.

#### Configuring basic security policies {#configure-base-security-fw-b}

[Configure basic security policies](#configure-base-security) same as for FW-A.

## Enable the route switcher {#enable-route-switcher}

After you complete the NGFW setup, make sure FW-A and FW-B health checks return `Healthy`. To do this, in the {{ yandex-cloud }} [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), navigate to the `mgmt` folder, select **{{ network-load-balancer-name }}**, and go to the `route-switcher-lb-...` page. Expand the target group and make sure the targets are `Healthy`. If they are `Unhealthy`, check that FW-A and FW-B are up and running and properly [configured](#configure-gateways).

Once FW-A and FW-B get the `Healthy` status, change the `route-switcher` module's `start_module` value to `true` in the `route-switcher.tf` file. To enable the module, run these commands:

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Within five minutes, the `route-switcher` module will start working, providing outbound traffic fault tolerance.

## Test the solution for performance and fault tolerance {#test-accessibility}

### Test the system {#test-accessibility}

1. To get the load balancer public IP address, run this command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   terraform output fw-alb_public_ip_address
   ```

1. Make sure your network infrastructure is accessible from outside by opening the following address in your browser:
    
   ```text
   http://<ALB_load_balancer_public_IP_address>
   ```
   You should see the `Welcome to nginx!` page.

1. Make sure the firewall rules allowing traffic are active. Do this by navigating to the `yc-dmz-with-high-available-ting-ngfw` folder on your PC and connecting to one of the DMZ VMs over SSH. Use the login from the `vm_admin_username` variable value for connection:

   ```bash
   cd yc-dmz-with-high-available-ting-ngfw
   ssh -i pt_key.pem <login>@<VM_internal_IP_address_in_DMZ_segment>
   ```

1. Connect to the FW-A management web interface at `https://192.168.1.10`. In the left-hand menu, in the **Firewall** section, select **Logs** -> **Live view**. In the log filter, select `label`, then `contains` and `ping from dmz to ya.ru`. Click `+`.

1. To check whether or not the DMZ VM can access a public resource on the internet, run this command:
   
   ```bash
   ping ya.ru
   ```

   The `ping from dmz to ya.ru` rule should allow the command to run.

1. On the **Firewall: Logs: Live view** page, check whether there is a record for allowed traffic to `ya.ru`. Stop the ping.

1. Make sure the firewall traffic-blocking rules are active.

   To check that `Jump VM` in the `mgmt` segment cannot be accessed from the `dmz` segment, run this command:

   ```bash
   ping 192.168.1.101
   ```
   The command should end with an error as per the firewall's default blocking rule.

### Testing fault tolerance {#fault-tolerance-check}

1. Install the `httping` utility for periodical HTTP requests on your PC:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install httping
   ```

1. To get the load balancer public IP address, run this command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   terraform output fw-alb_public_ip_address
   ```

1. Initiate DMZ application inbound traffic by making a request to the ALB public IP address:

   ```bash
   httping http://<ALB_load_balancer_public_IP_address>
   ```

1. Open another terminal window and connect to one of the DMZ VMs over SSH. Use the login from the `vm_admin_username` variable value for connection:
   
   ```bash
   ssh -i pt_key.pem <login>@<VM_internal_IP_address_in_DMZ_segment>
   ```

1. Set a password for the user specified in the `vm_admin_username` variable:

   ```bash
   sudo passwd <username>
   ```

1. In the {{ yandex-cloud }} [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), change the settings of this VM:

   1. In the list of services, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_compute }}**.
   1. In the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/server.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.group.switch_instances }}**.
   1. Click ![ellipsis](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) next to the VM you need and select ![pencil](../../_assets/console-icons/pencil.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.edit }}**.
   1. In the window that opens, under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.section_additional }}**, enable **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instance.overview.field_serial-port-enable }}**.
   1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instance.edit.button_update }}**.

1. Connect to the VM serial console, enter the username specified in the `vm_admin_username` variable and the password you created earlier.

1. Initiate outbound traffic from the DMZ VM to an internet resource by running `ping`:

   ```bash
   ping ya.ru
   ```

1. Emulate the main firewall failure by [stopping](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-stop-and-start.md#stop) the `FW-A` VM in the `mgmt` folder of the {{ yandex-cloud }} [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
1. Monitor the loss of `httping` and `ping` packets. After FW-A fails, you may experience a traffic loss for about one minute, then traffic should recover.
1. Make sure the `dmz-rt` route table uses the FW-B address for `next hop` in the `dmz` folder.
1. Emulate the main firewall recovery by [running](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-stop-and-start.md#start) the `FW-A` VM in the {{ yandex-cloud }} [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
1. Monitor the loss of `httping` and `ping` packets. After FW-A recovers, you may experience a traffic loss for about one minute, then traffic should recover.
1. Make sure the `dmz-rt` route table uses the FW-A address for `next hop` in the `dmz` folder.

## Production deployment requirements {#deployment-requirements}

* Save the `pt_key.pem` private SSH key to a secure location or recreate it without using {{ TF }}.
* Delete the public IP address of the jump VM if you are not going to use it.
* If your plan is to use it for connection to the management segment via WireGuard VPN, change the WireGuard keys both on the jump VM and admin workstation.
* Configure Smart-Soft TING for your specific needs in line with the corporate security policy.
* Do not assign public IP addresses to the VMs in segments where Smart-Soft TING routing tables with a default route of `0.0.0.0/0` are used (more on it [here](../../vpc/concepts/routing.md#restrictions)). The exception is the `mgmt` segment, where routing tables do not use the `0.0.0.0/0` default route. 

## How to delete the resources you created {#clear-out}

To stop paying for the resources you created, run this command:

   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

   {% note warning %}

   {{ TF }} will **permanently** delete all resources, such as networks, subnets, VMs, load balancers, folders, etc.

   {% endnote %}

As the resources you created reside in folders, a faster way to delete all resources is to delete all the folders using the {{ yandex-cloud }} [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) and then delete the `terraform.tfstate` file from the `yc-dmz-with-high-available-ting-ngfw` folder on your PC.
