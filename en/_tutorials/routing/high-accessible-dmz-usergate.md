# Implementing a secure high-availability network infrastructure with a dedicated DMZ based on the UserGate NGFW


Follow this tutorial to deploy a secure network infrastructure based on the [UserGate next-generation firewall](https://www.usergate.com/products/next-generation-firewall). The infrastructure is made up of segments, each containing single-purpose resources, isolated from other resources. For example, the [DMZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)) segment is reserved for public-facing applications, whereas the `mgmt` segment contains infrastructure management resources. Each segment will have its own cloud folder and a dedicated {{ vpc-short-name }} [cloud network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network). The segments communicate with each other via a [next-generation firewall (NGFW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next-generation_firewall) VM, which provides end-to-end protection and traffic control across the segments.

You can see the solution architecture in the diagram below.

![image](../../_assets/tutorials/high-accessible-dmz-usergate.png)

The solution comprises these main segments (folders):

* The **public** folder contains the internet-facing resources.
* The **mgmt** folder is for cloud infrastructure management and internal resources. It includes two VMs for infrastructure protection and network segmentation into security zones (`fw-a` and `fw-b`) and a VM with [WireGuard VPN](https://www.wireguard.com/) configured for secure access to the management segment (jump-vm).
* **dmz** that enables you to publish open-access applications.

For more information, see the [project repository](https://github.com/yandex-cloud-examples/yc-dmz-with-high-available-usergate-ngfw).

To deploy a secure high-availability network infrastructure with a dedicated DMZ based on the UserGate next-generation firewall:

1. [Get your cloud ready](#prepare-cloud).
1. [Set up your environment](#prepare-environment).
1. [Deploy your resources](#create-resources).
1. [Configure the NGFW](#configure-ngfw).
1. [Enable the route switcher](#enable-route-switcher).
1. [Test the solution for performance and fault tolerance](#test-accessibility).
1. [Requirements for production deployment](#deployment-requirements).

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out).

### Next-Generation Firewall {#next-generation-firewall}

An NGFW is used for cloud network protection and segmentation with a dedicated DMZ for public-facing applications.

[{{ marketplace-full-name }}]({{ link-cloud-marketplace }}?categories=security) offers multiple NGFW solutions. This scenario uses [UserGate NGFW]({{ link-cloud-marketplace }}/products/usergate/ngfw). Its features include:
* Firewalling.
* Intrusion detection and prevention.
* Traffic management and internet access control.
* Content filtering and application control.
* VPN server.
* Stream-based antivirus.
* Protection against DoS attacks and network flooding.

In this tutorial, we use the UserGate NGFW configuration with basic firewall and NAT rules.

Learn more about what UserGate NGFW can do in the [vendorâ€™s documentation](https://www.usergate.com/ru/products/usergate-vm).

## Configure the NGFW {#configure-ngfw}

This tutorial describes how to configure firewalls named FW-A and FW-B with the basic firewall and NAT rules required to test performance and fault tolerance in our scenario but insufficient for [production deployment](#deployment-requirements).

### Connect to the management segment via a VPN {#connect-via-vpn}

After deploying the infrastructure, the `mgmt` folder will contain the `jump-vm` Ubuntu instance with the configured [WireGuard VPN](https://www.wireguard.com/) providing secure connection. Set up a VPN tunnel to `jump-vm` on your PC to access the `mgmt`, `dmz`, and `public` segment subnets.

You can also connect to the jump VM over SSH using the SSH key from `terraform output` and the username from the `jump_vm_admin_username` variable.

To set up a VPN tunnel:

1. [Install](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) WireGuard on your PC.
1. Open WireGuard and click **Add Tunnel**.
1. In the dialog that opens, select the `jump-vm-wg.conf` file in the `yc-dmz-with-high-available-usergate-ngfw` directory.

1. Click **Activate** to activate the tunnel.
1. Check network connectivity with the management server via the WireGuard VPN tunnel by running the following command in the terminal:
   
   ```bash
   ping 192.168.1.101
   ```

   {% note warning %}

   If the packets fail to reach the management server, make sure the `mgmt-jump-vm-sg` [security group](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) rules for incoming traffic have your PC external IP address specified correctly.

   {% endnote %}

### Configure the FW-A firewall {#configure-fw-a}

Connect to the FW-A management web interface at `https://192.168.1.10:8001`. Use the default admin credentials: `Admin` for both username and password. After connecting, the system will prompt you to change your password.

#### Configuring basic security policies {#configure-base-security-fw-a}

1. In the top menu, go to **Settings** and select **Zones** in the left-hand menu under **Network**. Click the **Management** zone and go to the **Access control** tab. Make sure the ![image](../../_assets/common/yes.svg) option is enabled for **Administration console**. Click **Any** in the same row under **Allowed addresses**. Add the subnets allowed to access the UserGate administration console. Click **Add**. Enter `192.168.1.0/24` and click **Save**. Add the `192.168.2.0/24` subnet in the same way. Then, click **Save** in the **Select IP address/subnet** window.

1. For the **Management** zone, add the allowed `192.168.1.0/24` and `192.168.2.0/24` addresses to **CLI over SSH** in the same way to enable SSH access for managing UserGate.

1. For the **Management** zone, add the allowed `198.18.235.0/24` and `198.18.248.0/24` addresses to **Captive portal and block page** in the same way. These addresses are used by the `route-switcher-lb-...` network load balancer of the `route-switcher` module to check the UserGate availability.

1. In the left-hand menu, under **Libraries**, select **IP addresses**. In the **Groups** section, add groups. For each group, under **Addresses from the selected group**, add IP addresses according to this table:

   | Name | Threat level | Addresses from the selected group |
   | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
   | `mgmt` | Medium | `192.168.1.0/24`<br>`192.168.2.0/24` |
   | `dmz` | Medium | `10.160.1.0/24`<br>`10.160.2.0/24` |
   | `FW-a-public-IP` | Medium | `172.16.1.10` |

1. In the left-hand menu, under **Libraries**, select **Services** and click **Add**. In the **Name** field, specify `TCP_8080` and click **Add**. Select **tcp** as **Network protocol** and set **Destination ports** to `8080`. Click **Save** twice.

1. In the left-hand menu, under **Network policies**, select **NAT and routing**. Add a NAT rule to enable internet access from the `dmz` segment. In this case, the query request packet headers from the `dmz` segment to the internet will be translated to the source IP of the firewall interface in the `public` segment. Click **Add** and fill in the following fields in the **General** tab:
   * **Name**: `DMZ to internet`.
   * **Type**: Select `NAT` from the list.
   * **SNAT IP**: `172.16.1.10`.
   * **Logging**: Select `Log session start` from the list.

1. Switch to the **Source** tab and select the `DMZ` source zone. Under **Source address**, click **Add** and select **Add IP address list**. Select the `dmz` IP list.

1. Switch to the **Destination** tab and select the **Untrusted** destination zone. Leave the **Destination address** section empty to use any public IP address as the destination. In the **Rule properties** window, click **Save** to complete the NAT rule setup.

1. Add a destination NAT rule to route user requests to the traffic load balancer in the `dmz` segment, which distributes requests across a group of web servers hosting the test application. When configuring this rule, add source NAT to ensure the app response returns through the same firewall that processed the user request. Headers of packets received from {{ alb-name }} with user requests to the application published in `dmz` will be translated to the source IP of the firewall `dmz` interface and the destination IP of the web server traffic load balancer. Click **Add** and fill in the following fields in the **General** tab:
   * **Name**: `Internet to dmz-web-server`.
   * **Type**: Select `DNAT` from the list.
   * **SNAT IP**: `10.160.1.10`.
   * **Logging**: Select `Log session start` from the list.

1. Switch to the **Source** tab and select the **Untrusted** source zone. Leave the **Source address** section empty to use any IP address as the source.

1. Switch to the **Destination** tab. Under **Destination address**, click **Add** and select **Add IP address list**. Select the `FW-a-public-IP` IP list.

1. Switch to the **Service** tab and click **Add**. Select `TCP_8080` from the list, click **Add** and then **Close**. 

1. Switch to the **DNAT** tab. In the **DNAT destination address** field, enter `10.160.1.100`. Check **Enable SNAT**. In the **Rule properties** window, click **Save** to complete adding a DNAT rule.

   {% note info %}

      NAT rules are applied in the order they are listed, from top to bottom. Only the first rule for which all the conditions are met will apply. Which means, the more specific rules should be higher on the list than the more general ones.

   {% endnote %}

1. In the left-hand menu, under **Network policies**, select **Firewall** to add firewall rules. Click **Add** and fill in the following fields in the **General** tab:
   * **Name**: `Web-server port forwarding on FW-a`.
   * **Action**: Select `Allow` from the list.
   * **Logging**: Select `Log session start` from the list.

1. Switch to the **Source** tab and select the **Untrusted** source zone. Leave the **Source address** section empty to use any IP address as the source.

1. Switch to the **Destination** tab and select the **DMZ** destination zone. Under **Destination address**, click **Add** and select **Add IP address list**. Select the `dmz-web-server` IP list.

1. Switch to the **Service** tab and click **Add**. Select `TCP_8080` from the list, click **Add** and then **Close**. In the **Firewall rule properties** window, click **Save** to complete the rule setup.

1. Add the remaining rules from the table below to complete the configuration example with basic rules for testing firewall policies, publishing a test application from the `dmz` segment, and testing its fault tolerance. Note that you do not need to recreate the `Web-server port forwarding on FW-a` rule. 

   | # | Name | Action | Logging | Source zone | Source address | Destination zone | Destination address | Service |
   | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
   | 1 | `Web-server port forwarding on FW-a` | Allow | Log session start | `Untrusted` | Any | `DMZ` | `dmz-web-server` | `TCP_8080` |
   | 2 | `Mgmt to DMZ` | Allow | Log session start | `Management` | `mgmt` | `DMZ` | `dmz` | Any |
   | 3 | `Ping from dmz to internet` | Allow | Log session start | `DMZ` | `dmz` | `Untrusted` | Any | `Any ICMP` |
   | 4 | `Block all` | Deny | No | Any | Any | Any | Any | Any |

   {% note info %}

      Rules are processed one by one in the order they are listed, from top to bottom. Only the first rule for which all the conditions are met will apply. Which means, the more specific rules should be higher on the list than the more general ones. The `Block all` rule is used to prohibit any transit traffic through UserGate and should be placed at the end of the list. This is a required rule since the default `Default block` rule does not block traffic allowed by a DNAT rule.

   {% endnote %}

## Enable the route switcher {#enable-route-switcher}

After you complete the NGFW setup, make sure FW-A and FW-B health checks return `Healthy`. To do this, in the {{ yandex-cloud }} [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), navigate to the `mgmt` folder, select **{{ network-load-balancer-name }}**, and go to the `route-switcher-lb-...` page. Expand the target group and make sure the targets are `Healthy`. If they are `Unhealthy`, check that FW-A and FW-B are up and running and properly [configured](#configure-gateways).

Once FW-A and FW-B get the `Healthy` status, change the `route-switcher` module's `start_module` value to `true` in the `route-switcher.tf` file. To enable the module, run this command:

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Within five minutes, the `route-switcher` module will start working, providing outbound traffic fault tolerance.

## Test the solution for performance and fault tolerance {#test-accessibility}

### Test the system {#test-accessibility}

1. To get the load balancer public IP address, run this command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   terraform output fw-alb_public_ip_address
   ```

1. Make sure your network infrastructure is accessible from outside by opening the following address in your browser:
    
   ```text
   http://<ALB_load_balancer_public_IP_address>
   ```
   You should see the `Welcome to nginx!` page.

1. Make sure the firewall security policy rules that allow traffic are active. To do this, go to the `yc-dmz-with-high-available-usergate-ngfw` folder on your PC and connect to a VM in the DMZ segment over SSH:

   ```bash
   cd yc-dmz-with-high-available-usergate-ngfw
   ssh -i pt_key.pem admin@<VM_internal_IP_address_in_DMZ_segment>
   ```

1. To check whether the DMZ-hosted VM has internet access, run this command:
   
   ```bash
   ping ya.ru
   ```

   The command must run according to the `ping from dmz to internet` rule that allows traffic.

1. Connect to the FW-A management web interface at `https://192.168.1.10:8001`. In the top menu, go to **Settings** and select **Firewall** in the left-hand menu under **Network policies**. Configure logging for the `Block all` rule: `Log session start`. 

1. Make sure the security policy rules that prohibit traffic are applied.

   To check that `Jump VM` in the `mgmt` segment cannot be accessed from the `dmz` segment, run this command: 

   ```bash
   ping 192.168.1.101
   ```
   The command should end with an error according to the `Block all` rule.

1. Connect to the FW-A management web interface at `https://192.168.1.10:8001`. In the top menu, go to **Logs and reports** and select **Traffic log** in the left-hand menu under **Logs**. In the `Rules:` filter, select `Block all` and `ping from dmz to internet`. Make sure the logs include records of allowed and blocked traffic for the tests performed. After that, disable logging for the `Block all` rule. 

### Testing fault tolerance {#fault-tolerance-check}

1. Install `httping` for making HTTP requests on your PC:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install httping
   ```

1. To get the load balancer public IP address, run this command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   terraform output fw-alb_public_ip_address
   ```

1. Initiate DMZ application inbound traffic by making a request to the ALB public IP address:

   ```bash
   httping http://<ALB_load_balancer_public_IP_address>
   ```

1. Open another terminal window and connect to a DMZ VM over SSH:
   
   ```bash
   ssh -i pt_key.pem admin@<VM_internal_IP_address_in_DMZ_segment>
   ```

1. Set a password for the `admin` user:

   ```bash
   sudo passwd admin
   ```

1. In the {{ yandex-cloud }} [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), change the settings of this VM:

   1. In the list of services, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_compute }}**.
   1. In the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/server.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances_jsoza }}**.
   1. Click ![ellipsis](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) next to the VM you need and select ![pencil](../../_assets/console-icons/pencil.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.edit }}**.
   1. In the window that opens, under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.section_additional }}**, enable **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instance.overview.field_serial-port-enable }}**.
   1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instance.edit.button_update }}**.
   
1. Connect to the VM serial console, enter the `admin` username and the password you set earlier.

1. Initiate outbound traffic from the DMZ VM to an internet resource by running `ping`:

   ```bash
   ping ya.ru
   ```

1. Emulate the main firewall failure by [stopping](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-stop-and-start.md#stop) the `FW-A` VM in the `mgmt` folder of the {{ yandex-cloud }} [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
1. Monitor the loss of `httping` and `ping` packets. After FW-A fails, you may experience traffic loss for about one minute, then traffic should resume.
1. Make sure the `dmz-rt` route table in the `dmz` folder uses the `FW-B` address as `next hop`.
1. Emulate the main firewall recovery by [running](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-stop-and-start.md#start) the `FW-A` VM in the {{ yandex-cloud }} [management console]({{ link-console-main }}). 
1. Monitor the loss of `httping` and `ping` packets. After FW-A recovers, you may experience traffic loss for about one minute, then traffic should resume.
1. Make sure the `dmz-rt` route table uses the FW-A address for `next hop` in the `dmz` folder.

## Production deployment requirements {#deployment-requirements}

* Save the `pt_key.pem` private SSH key to a secure location or recreate it separately from {{ TF }}.
* Delete the public IP address of the jump VM if you are not going to use it.
* If your plan is to use it for connection to the management segment via WireGuard VPN, change the WireGuard keys both on the jump VM and admin workstation.
* Configure the UserGate NGFW to meet your specific needs in line with the corporate security policy.
* Do not assign public IP addresses to the VMs in those segments where the UserGate NGFW routing tables with a default route of `0.0.0.0/0` are used (learn more [here](../../vpc/concepts/routing.md#restrictions)). The only exception is the `mgmt` segment where routing tables do not use the `0.0.0.0/0` default route. 

## How to delete the resources you created {#clear-out}

To stop paying for the resources you created, run this command:

   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

   {% note warning %}

   {{ TF }} will **permanently** delete all resources, such as networks, subnets, VMs, load balancers, folders, etc.

   {% endnote %}

As the resources you created reside in folders, a faster way to delete all resources is to delete all the folders using the {{ yandex-cloud }} [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) and then delete the `terraform.tfstate` file from the `yc-dmz-with-high-available-usergate-ngfw` folder on your PC.
