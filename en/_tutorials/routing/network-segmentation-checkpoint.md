# Cloud infrastructure segmentation with the Check Point next-generation firewall

In this tutorial, we will deploy a secure network infrastructure based on the Check Point next-generation firewall. It will include three segments hosting resources grouped by function and isolated from other resources. We will host public-facing applications in the [DMZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)) segment and cloud management resources in the `mgmt` segment. The segments will communicate through a [Check Point](https://www.checkpoint.com/quantum/next-generation-firewall/) [next-generation firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next-generation_firewall) VM providing end-to-end protection and traffic management between the segments.

If you need to ensure the NGFW’s fault tolerance and the deployed applications’ high availability, use [this recommended solution](../../tutorials/routing/high-accessible-dmz.md).

You can see the structure we described on the diagram below.

![image](../../_assets/tutorials/network-segmentation-checkpoint.svg)

We will use the following folders:

* The **public** folder contains internet-facing resources.
* The **mgmt** folder is for cloud infrastructure management and internal resources. It includes VMs for infrastructure protection and network segmentation into security zones (`fw`), a VM of the centralized firewall management server (`mgmt-server`), and a [WireGuard VPN](https://www.wireguard.com/) VM for secure management segment access (`jump-vm`).
* The **`dmz`** folder enables you to publish open-access applications .

For more information, see the [project repository](https://github.com/yandex-cloud-examples/yc-network-segmentation-with-checkpoint). 

To deploy a secure Check Point NGFW-based network infrastructure:

1. [Get your cloud ready](#prepare-cloud).
1. [Set up your environment](#prepare-environment).
1. [Deploy your resources](#create-resources).
1. [Set up your firewall gateway](#configure-gateway).
1. [Test the solution](#test-functionality).
1. [Requirements for production deployment](#deployment-requirements).

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out).

### Next-Generation Firewall {#next-generation-firewall}

[{{ marketplace-full-name }}](/marketplace?categories=security) offers multiple NGFW solutions. This scenario uses [Check Point CloudGuard IaaS](/marketplace?publishers=f2evobrhpbdrcue7s9l5&tab=software). Its features include:
* Firewall, NAT, IPS, antivirus, and anti-bot protection.
* Application layer granular traffic management, session logging.
* Centralized Check Point security management.
* In our example, we will configure Check Point firewall with basic access control and NAT policies.

Yandex Cloud Marketplace offers PAYG and BYOL licensing for Check Point CloudGuard IaaS. We will use BYOL with a 15-day trial:
* NGFW VM: Check Point CloudGuard IaaS: Firewall & Threat Prevention BYOL.
* Management server VM: Check Point CloudGuard IaaS: Security Management BYOL for NGFW management tasks.

For production deployment, we recommend to use the following options:
* NGFW [Check Point CloudGuard IaaS - Firewall & Threat Prevention PAYG](/marketplace/products/checkpoint/cloudguard-iaas-firewall-tp-payg-m)
* Separate license for the Check Point CloudGuard IaaS: Security Management server. Alternatively, you can use your on-premise server.

## Get your cloud ready {#prepare-cloud}

{% include [before-you-begin](../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}

### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The infrastructure support cost includes:

* Fee for continuously running VMs (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* Fee for public IP addresses and outgoing traffic (see [{{ vpc-full-name }} pricing](../../vpc/pricing.md)).

### Required quotas {#required-quotes}

{% note warning %}

In this tutorial, you will deploy a resource-intensive infrastructure.

{% endnote %}

Make sure you have sufficient cloud [quotas](../../overview/concepts/quotas-limits.md) not used by other projects.

{% cut "Resources used by this tutorial" %}

| Resource | Quantity |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Folders | 3 |
| Virtual machines | 4 |
| VM vCPUs | 12 |
| VM RAM | 20 GB |

{% endcut %}

## Set up your environment {#prepare-environment}

This tutorial uses Windows software and [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) (WSL).
To deploy the infrastructure, we will use [{{ TF }}](https://www.terraform.io/). 

### Configure WSL {#setup-wsl}

1. Check whether you have WSL installed on your PC. To do this, run this command in the CLI terminal:
  
   ```bash
   wsl -l
   ```

   If WSL is installed, the terminal will return a list of available distributions, such as the following:
   
   ```bash
   Windows Subsystem for Linux Distributions:
   docker-desktop (Default)
   docker-desktop-data
   Ubuntu
   ```

1. If WSL is not installed, [install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) it and repeat the previous step.
1. Additionally, you can install your preferred Linux distribution, e.g., [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-11-with-gui-support#1-overview), on top of WSL.

1. To make it the default system, run this command:
   
   ```bash
   wsl --setdefault ubuntu
   ```

1. To switch your terminal to Linux, run this command:

   ```bash
   wsl ~
   ```

{% note info %}

We use the Linux terminal to perform the following steps.

Learn more about Check Point features and configuration options with our free course, [A Deep Dive into Network Security](https://yandex.cloud/ru/training/network-security).

### Connect to the management segment via a VPN {#connect-via-vpn}

After deploying the infrastructure, the `mgmt` folder will contain the `jump-vm` Ubuntu instance with the configured [WireGuard VPN](https://www.wireguard.com/) providing secure connection. Set up a VPN tunnel between your PC and `jump-vm` so you can access the `mgmt`, `dmz`, and `public` segment subnets.

To set up a VPN tunnel:

1. Get your Linux username:

   ```bash
   whoami
   ```

1. [Install](https://download.wireguard.com/windows-client/wireguard-installer.exe) WireGuard on your PC.
1. Open WireGuard and click **Add Tunnel**.
1. In the dialog that opens, select the `jump-vm-wg.conf` file in the `yc-network-segmentation-with-checkpoint` directory.
   To find a Linux, e.g., Ubuntu, directory, type the file path in the dialog address bar:

   ```bash
   \\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\<Ubuntu_user_name>\yc-network-segmentation-with-checkpoint
   ```
   
   Where `<Ubuntu_user_name>` is your Linux username you got in the previous step.

1. Click **Activate** to activate the tunnel.
1. Check whether you can connect to the management server through the VPN tunnel by running this command in the terminal:
   
   ```bash
   ping 192.168.1.100
   ```

   {% note warning %}

   If `ping` fails, make sure the `mgmt-jump-vm-sg` [security group](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) inbound rules include your PC external IP address.

   {% endnote %}

### Run SmartConsole {#setup-smartconsole}

To set up and manage [Check Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_Point), install and run the SmartConsole GUI client:

### Create a static NAT table {#setup-static-nat}

The destination NAT will route internet user requests to the DMZ-hosted web server.

It will translate packet headers, replacing the destination IP address and port number with the web server IP address and TCP port 8080, respectively.

To set up the firewall gateway NAT table:

1. Navigate to the **NAT** section under **Access Control**.
1. In the rule table menu, select **Add rule to top**.
1. In the new line that appears:
   * In the **Original Destination** column, select `FW-public-IP`.
   * In the **Original Services** column, select `http`.
   * In the **Translated Destination** column, select `dmz-web-server`.
   * In the **Translated Services** column, select `TCP_8080`.

   The new rule will appear in the NAT rule table:

   | No | Original Source | Original Destination | Original Services | Translated Source | Translated Destination | Translated Services | Install On |
   | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
   | 1 | Any | FW-public-IP | http | Original | dmz-web-server | TCP_8080 | Policy Targets (All gateways) |

### Apply the security policy rules {#apply-policies}

1. Click **Install Policy** at the top left of the screen.
1. In the dialog that opens, click **Publish & Install**.
1. In the next dialog, click **Install** and wait for the process to complete.

## Test the solution {#test-functionality}

1. To get the firewall public IP address, run this command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   terraform output fw_public_ip_address
   ```

1. Make sure you can access your network infrastructure from the internet by opening the following address in your browser:

   ```bash
   http://<FW_public_IP_address>
   ```
   If your system is accessible from the internet, you will see the `Welcome to nginx!` page.

1. Make sure the firewall rules allowing traffic are active by navigating to the `yc-network-segmentation-with-checkpoint` directory on your PC and connecting to the DMZ-hosted VM over SSH:

   ```bash
   cd ~/yc-network-segmentation-with-checkpoint
   ssh -i pt_key.pem admin@<internal_IP_address_of_VM_in_DMZ_segment>
   ```

1. To check whether the DMZ-hosted VM has internet access, run this command:    

   ```bash
   ping ya.ru
   ```

   The `ping from dmz to internet` rule should allow the command to run.

1. Make sure the firewall traffic-blocking rules are active.
   To check that the `jump` VM in the `mgmt` segment is not accessible from DMZ, run this command: 

   ```bash
   ping 192.168.1.101
   ```

   The `Cleanup rule` should block the command.

1. In SmartConsole, navigate to the `Logs` tab of the `LOGS & MONITOR` section, find the entries made while you tested the firewall rules, and see which rules were applied.

## Production deployment requirements {#deployment-requirements}

* To ensure NGFW fault tolerance and applicatoin high availability, use [this recommended solution](../../tutorials/routing/high-accessible-dmz.md).
* Make sure to change the passwords transferred through the metadata service in `check-init...yaml` files:
   * SIC password for connecting the firewall and the firewall management server.
   * Check Point SmartConsole password.
   * Firewall management server admin password. You can change this password in Gaia Portal.
* Save the `pt_key.pem` private SSH key to a secure location or recreate it without using {{ TF }}.
* If you do not plan on using the `jump` VM further, delete its public IP address.
* If you plan to connect to the `mgmt` segment through the `jump` VM WireGuard VPN, change the WireGuard keys on the `jump` VM and your remote PC, e.g., admin workstation.
* Set up access control and NAT policies for your Check Point NGFW configuration.
* Set up security group rules for applications deployed in different segments.
* Do not assign public IP addresses to the VMs in the segments protected by the Check Point NGFW rules and routing, with the exception of the `mgmt` segment where routing tables do not use the `0.0.0.0/0` default route. 
* Select your preferred Check Point CloudGuard IaaS license and image (see [Next-Generation Firewall](#next-generation-firewall)).

## How to delete the resources you created {#clear-out}

To stop paying for the resources you created, run this command:

   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```
   {{ TF }} will **permanently** delete all resources you created, including networks, subnets, VMs, folders, etc.

You can delete your resources faster by deleting all folders in {{ yandex-cloud }} console and then deleting the `terraform.tfstate` file from the `yc-network-segmentation-with-checkpoint` folder on your PC.
