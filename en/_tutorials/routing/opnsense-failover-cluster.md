# Configuring an OPNsense firewall in high availability cluster mode on {{ baremetal-full-name }} servers

This solution allows configuring [OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/) as a perimeter firewall on {{ baremetal-name }} [servers](../../baremetal/concepts/servers.md). Apart from being the main gateway and a [stateful firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateful_firewall), OPNsense will also function as a highly available [DHCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol) server.

The core of this solution is to ensure that only the OPNsense [firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)) servers have internet access, thus ensuring a secure network segment for your internal systems.

To ensure fault tolerance, this solution uses a [high availability cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-availability_cluster). To keep the gateway highly available, the proposed configuration uses the Common Address Redundancy Protocol ([CARP](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/advanced-networking/#carp)).

To provide automatic IP addressing and correct gateway assignment for clients in the protected network segment, this approach uses a highly available ISC DHCPv4 server. OPNsense supports replicating the DHCP address pool between Master and Backup servers.

You can see the solution architecture in the diagram below:

![opnsense-failover-cluster](../../_assets/tutorials/opnsense-failover-cluster.svg)

* [Public {{ baremetal-name }} subnet](../../baremetal/concepts/network.md#public-network) of the `{{ region-id }}-m4` [server pool](../../baremetal/concepts/servers.md#server-pools).
* {{ baremetal-name }} [private subnet](../../baremetal/concepts/network.md#private-subnet): `opnsense-private-subnet-m4`.
* Two {{ baremetal-name }} servers within the OPNsense cluster: `opnsense-master` and `opnsense-backup`. The configuration examples in this tutorial use OPNsense `25.1`.
* One {{ baremetal-name }} server running the VMware [ESXi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware_ESXi) virtualization platform: `vmware-esxi`. This tutorial uses ESXi `7.0U3g`.
* VM running on the `vmware-esxi` server: `opnsense-tester-vm`. This tutorial uses a [Linux Ubuntu 24.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/24.04/) VM without a graphical user interface (GUI).
* [Jump server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_server) used to configure OPNsense and ESXi servers and access their private IP addresses: `jump-server`.

    The jump server must have a [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) and a [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser). To make the configuration process easier for you, this tutorial uses a {{ baremetal-name }} server as the jump server, booted into recovery and diagnostics mode from the [Rescue CD](../../baremetal/operations/servers/rescue-boot.md).

    {% note info %}

    As an alternative to the Rescue CD, you can use a VPN connection to access the private IP addresses of your servers from outside the private subnet. To use a VPN connection on OPNsense servers, you will need to configure a static route to the network segment outside the current private subnet.

    {% endnote %}

To configure your OPNsense firewall in high availability cluster mode on {{ baremetal-full-name }} servers:

1. [Get your cloud ready](#before-you-begin).
1. [Create your boot images in {{ baremetal-name }}](#create-images).
1. [Create a {{ baremetal-name }} private subnet](#create-subnet).
1. [Lease {{ baremetal-name }} servers](#rent-servers).
1. [Configure an OPNsense high availability cluster](#setup-opnsense).
1. [Install a hypervisor and create a virtual machine](#setup-esxi).
1. [Test the solution](#test-solution).

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out).


## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}

### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The cost of the proposed solution includes: 
* Fee for leasing the {{ baremetal-name }} servers (see [{{ baremetal-full-name }} pricing](../../baremetal/pricing.md)).
* Fee for [data storage](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md) in {{ objstorage-name }} and data [operations](../../storage/operations/index.md) (see [{{ objstorage-full-name }} pricing](../../storage/pricing.md)).

## Create your boot images in {{ baremetal-name }} {#create-images}

You will use custom {{ baremetal-name }} boot images to install OPNsense and ESXi on your {{ baremetal-name }} servers. Make sure to configure these images before you start deploying your infrastructure.

### Upload the software ISO images to {{ objstorage-full-name }} {#upload-isos}

To build the infrastructure described in this solution, you will need [ISO images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_disc_image) with distributions to install OPNsense and VMware ESXi on your servers.

{% note info %}

{{ yandex-cloud }} does not provide these software distributions; you should purchase them yourself.

{% endnote %}

Upload the OPNsense and ESXi installation images to your [{{ objstorage-name }}](../../storage/index.yaml) bucket:

1. If you have no {{ objstorage-name }} [bucket](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md) yet, [create](../../storage/operations/buckets/create.md) one with limited access.
1. Upload the images to your bucket using the [management console](../../storage/operations/objects/upload.md), [AWS CLI](../../storage/tools/aws-cli.md), or [WinSCP](../../storage/tools/winscp.md). Within {{ objstorage-name }}, uploaded images are classified as _objects_.
1. [Get links](../../storage/operations/objects/link-for-download.md) to the images you uploaded. Use these links when creating your boot images in {{ baremetal-name }}.

### Create your boot images in {{ baremetal-name }} {#create-image}

It may take up to 20 minutes to provision the servers. During this time, the servers will have the `Provisioning` status, then switching to `Ready`.

{% endnote %}


## Configure an OPNsense high availability cluster {#setup-opnsense}

Configuring a high availability cluster involves installing the OPNsense firewall on two {{ baremetal-name }} servers, followed by creating and configuring an OPNsense cluster from those servers.

### Install the OPNsense firewall on your servers {#opnsense-server-installation}

{% note tip %}

To save time, you can run the OPNsense installation on your `opnsense-master` and `opnsense-backup` servers in two different browser windows at the same time, as the installation steps are the same for both.

{% endnote %}

1. [Connect](../../baremetal/operations/servers/server-kvm.md) to the `opnsense-master` server's KVM console.

    {% include [kvm-console-actions-notice](../_tutorials_includes/opnsense-failover-cluster/kvm-console-actions-notice.md) %}

1. In the KVM console window, select **Media** → **Virtual Media Wizard...** in the top menu or click the CD icon. In the window that opens:

      1. In the **CD/DVD Media1** section, click **Browse** and select the OPNsense image you saved earlier in the `user-iso` directory.
      1. Click **Connect CD/DVD**.
      1. Check the **Status** section for the **Virtual CD 1** device to make sure the **Connected To** field now gives the path to the image you selected, and click **Close**.
1. To boot the server up from the selected image, click **Reboot to cdrom** in the top-right corner of the KVM console.
1. Wait for the server to boot up and for the OPNsense interactive shell to initialize. This can take up to ten minutes.

    When the initialization is complete, the terminal screen in the KVM console will prompt you for authentication:

    ```
    login:
    ```
1. Authenticate with the following credentials:

    * Username: `installer`
    * Password: `opnsense`

    {% include [kvm-paste-tip](../../_includes/baremetal/kvm-paste-tip.md) %}
1. In the **Keymap Selection** window, keep the default value, `Continue with default keymap`, and press **Enter**.
1. In the action selection dialog box, select `Install (ZFS)` and press **Enter**.
1. In the **ZFS Configuration** window, select `mirror` and press **Enter**.
1. In the next window listing available block devices, use the **up and down arrow keys** to move through and **spacebar** to select the server HDDs or SSDs, e.g., `sda0` and `sda1`, to include in the virtual RAID array. Press **Enter**.
1. When prompted with a warning about potential data loss, confirm that you agree to modify the partition table: use the **left and right arrow keys** to highlight `YES` and press **Enter**.

    This will start OPNsense installation on the server.

    {% note alert %}

    During the installation, do not close or refresh the KVM console window. Otherwise, the installation image will be unmounted from the {{ baremetal-name }} server, and you will have to restart the installation.

    The installation may take up to an hour.

    {% endnote %}
1. Once the installation is complete, select `Root Password` in the **Final Configuration** window to set a password for the `root` user and press **Enter**. Enter and confirm the password.
1. Once you set the password, select `Complete Install` in the **Final Configuration** window and press **Enter**.
1. In the **Installation Complete** window, select `Reboot now` and press **Enter**.
1. In the KVM console window, select **Media** → **Virtual Media Wizard...** in the top menu or click the CD icon. In the window that opens:

      1. Under **CD/DVD Media1**, click **Disconnect**. Check the **Status** section for the **Virtual CD 1** device to make sure the **Connected To** field value has changed to `Not connected`.
      1. Click **Close**.
1. Similarly, install OPNsense on the `opnsense-backup` server.

### Pre-configure your OPNsense servers {#opnsense-basic-config}

Before you proceed with setting up the OPNsense cluster, pre-configure the network interfaces of both your OPNsense servers:

1. [Connect](../../baremetal/operations/servers/server-kvm.md) to the OPNsense server's KVM console.

    {% include [kvm-console-actions-notice](../_tutorials_includes/opnsense-failover-cluster/kvm-console-actions-notice.md) %}

1. Authenticate as the `root` user with the password you set when installing the server. If you have not set any custom password for the `root` user, the default one is `opnsense`.

    If authenticated successfully, you will see a text menu of basic server settings with a list of possible actions.
1. Make sure the network interfaces are properly configured:

    {% note info %}

    {{ baremetal-name }} server can be equipped with either `Intel` or `Mellanox` network cards, depending on the configuration. While the OS kernel automatically configures `Intel` network interfaces, configuring `Mellanox` network interfaces may involve additional steps.

    {% endnote %}

    1. Type `8` (the `Shell` option) and press **Enter** to open the OS terminal.
    1. Check for available network interfaces:

        ```bash
        ifconfig
        ```

        If the command output shows the `LAN` and `WAN` interface descriptions (`description`), there is no need for additional configuration. 

        Here is an example:

        ```text
        igb0: flags=1008843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST,LOWER_UP> metric 0 mt
            description: LAN (lan)
            options=4802028<VLAN_MTU,JUMBO_MTU,WOL_MAGIC,HWSTATS,MEXTPG>
            ether 00:25:90:3:a1:fe
            inet 192.168.1.1 netmask Oxffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255
            inet6 fe80::225:90ff:fee3:a1fe%igb0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1
            media: Ethernet autoselect (1000baseT ‹full-duplex>)
            status: active
            nd6 options=21<PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL>

        igb1: flags=1008843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST,LOWER_UP> metric 0 mt
            description: WAN (wan)
            options=4800028<VLAN_MTU,JUMBO_MTU,HWSTATS,MEXTPG>
            ether 00:25:90:3:a1:ff
            inet 94.126.204.143 netmask Oxfffffffe broadcast 94.126.204.143
            inet6 fe80::225:90ff:fee3:a1ff%igb1 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x2
            media: Ethernet autoselect (1000baseT <full-duplex>)
            status: active
            nd6 options=23<PERFORMNUD,ACCEPT_RTADV,AUTO_LINKLOCAL>
        ```

        In the example above, the `igb0` and `igb1` network interfaces have the `LAN` and `WAN` descriptions, respectively, and IP addresses assigned. This means you can proceed to the next step.

        {% cut "**What to do if the output features no `LAN` and `WAN` interfaces with addresses assigned.**" %}

        1. Create and open an additional configuration file named `loader.conf.local`:

            ```bash
            ee /boot/loader.conf.local
            ```
        1. Add the following line to the new configuration file:

            ```text
            mlx4en_load="YES"
            ```
        1. Save the changes and close the file. To do this, press **Esc + Enter** and type `a` in the window that opens.
        1. Reboot the system:

            ```bash
            reboot
            ```
        1. Wait for the reboot to complete, log in, and open the OS terminal.
        1. Re-run the `ifconfig` command to make sure the required network interfaces are now available in your system. The `Mellanox` interfaces will have the following IDs: `mlxen0` and `mlxen1`.

        {% endcut %}

    1. Exit the OS terminal:

        ```bash
        exit
        ```
1. Configure the server LAN interface:

    1. Type `2` (the `Set interface IP address` option) and press **Enter**:

        ```text
        1 - LAN (igb0 - static, track6)
        2 - WAN (igb1 - dhcp, dhep6)
        ```
    1. Type the LAN interface number and press **Enter**.
    1. `Configure IPv4 address LAN interface via DHCP? [y/N]`:

        Enter `n` to set a static IPv4 address for the interface.
    1. `Enter the new LAN IPv4 address. Press <ENTER> for none`:

        {% list tabs group=host_type %}

        - Master {#master}

          Enter the address: `192.168.1.252`.

        - Backup {#backup}

          Enter the address: `192.168.1.253`.

        {% endlist %}

    1. `Enter the new LAN IPv4 subnet bit count (1 to 32)`:

        Enter the subnet [CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) prefix, e.g., `24`.
    1. `For a WAN, enter the new LAN IPv4 upstream gateway address. For a LAN, press <ENTER> for none`:

        Press **Enter** to skip setting the gateway address.
    1. `Configure IPv6 address LAN interface via WAN tracking? [Y/n]`:

        Enter `n` to skip configuring the IPv6 address using Track Interface.
    1. `Configure IPv6 address LAN interface via DHCP6? [y/N]`:

        Enter `n` to skip configuring the IPv6 address via DHCP6.
    1. `Enter the new LAN IPv6 address. Press <ENTER> for none`:

        Press **Enter** to skip setting the IPv6 address.
    1. `Do you want to enable the DHCP server on LAN? [y/N]`:

        Enter `n` to skip configuring the DHCP server. You will configure it later via the web interface.
    1. `Do you want to change the web GUI protocol from HTTPS to HTTP? [y/N]`:

        Enter `y` to use HTTP to access the server configuration web interface.
    1. `Restore web GUI access defaults? [y/N]`:

        Enter `y` to use default settings to access the server configuration web interface.

    Your OPNsense server settings will be updated, and you can then further configure the OPNsense servers and cluster via the web interface at the specified addresses:

    {% list tabs group=host_type %}

    - Master {#master}

      ```text
      You can now access the web GUI by opening the following URL in your web browser:

      http://192.168.1.252
      ```

    - Backup {#backup}

      ```text
      You can now access the web GUI by opening the following URL in your web browser:

      http://192.168.1.253
      ```

    {% endlist %}

    {% cut "Additional settings for connection to the web interface via VPN." %}

    1. Type `8` (the `Shell` option) and press **Enter** to open the OS terminal.
    1. Configure the static route to the VPN segment of the network:

        {% list tabs group=host_type %}

        - Master {#master}

          route add <VPN_segment_CIDR> 192.168.1.252
          ```

        - Backup {#backup}

          ```bash
          route add <VPN_segment_CIDR> 192.168.1.253
          ```

        {% endlist %}

        Where `<VPN_segment_CIDR>` is the CIDR of a subnet in the VPN segment, e.g., `172.28.1.0/24`.
    1. Make sure the route has been added:

        ```bash
        netstat -rn4
        ```

        The command output should contain a routing entry in this format:

        {% list tabs group=host_type %}

        - Master {#master}

          ```text
          172.28.2.0/24  192.168.1.252. UGS. mlxen1

          ```

        {% endlist %}

    {% endcut %}

The OPNsense server pre-configuration is now complete. To further configure the servers and cluster, access the web interface.

### Set up an OPNsense server cluster {#opnsense-cluster-config}

To set up an OPNsense server cluster, you need a jump server with a graphical user interface and access to the private subnet to which the cluster hosts are connected. 

To make the configuration process easier for you, this tutorial uses a previously leased server, `jump-server`, as the jump server, booted into recovery and diagnostics mode from the [Rescue CD](../../baremetal/operations/servers/rescue-boot.md).

{% include [kvm-console-actions-notice](../_tutorials_includes/opnsense-failover-cluster/kvm-console-actions-notice.md) %}

1. [Start](../../baremetal/operations/servers/rescue-boot.md#boot-up) `jump-server` from the Rescue CD by selecting the default boot option, `Boot SystemRescue using default options`, in the SystemRescue main menu.

    Running SystemRescue will launch the SystemRescue terminal in the KVM console.

1. Run `startx` in the SystemRescue terminal to start the GUI.
1. As `opnsense-private-subnet-m4` has no DHCP server yet, configure the network interface manually:

    1. Look up the MAC address of the `jump-server` network interface connected to the private subnet.

        You can [look up](../../baremetal/operations/servers/get-info.md) the MAC address of the {{ baremetal-name }} server network interface of your choice on the `jump-server` information page under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.baremetal.title_section-server-private-network }}**.

        Save the MAC address until the next step.
    1. Learn the name of the `jump-server` network interface connected to the private subnet in the SystemRescue graphical shell:

        1. In the bottom-right corner of the SystemRescue GUI, right-click the network icon and select `Connection Information`.
        1. On the tabs with the **Wired connection 1** and **Wired connection 2** Ethernet interface names, look at the **Hardware Address** field value. The interface of interest will have a value identical to the MAC address saved in the previous step.
    1. In the bottom-right corner of the SystemRescue GUI, right-click the network icon and select `Edit Connections...`.
    1. In the window that opens, under **Ethernet**, select the name of the network interface connected to the private subnet you just learned and click the gear icon.
    1. In the settings window that opens, go to the **IPv4 Settings** tab and select `Manual` in the **Method** field.
    1. Under **Addresses**, click **Add**. In the **Address** field, enter `192.168.1.20`; in the **Netmask** field, `24`.
    1. Click **Save**.
1. Make sure you can now connect to the OPNsense servers via the network. To do this, click the terminal icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen; in the window that opens, run this command:

    ```bash
    ping 192.168.1.252 -c3
    ```

    Result:

    ```bash
    PING 192.168.1.252 (192.168.1.252) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 192.168.1.252: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.110 ms
    64 bytes from 192.168.1.252: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.127 ms
    64 bytes from 192.168.1.252: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.115 ms

    --- 192.168.1.252 ping statistics ---
    3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2024ms
    tt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.110/0.117/0.127/0.007 ms
    ```

    Network connectivity with the OPNsense server has now been established.

### Create a VM {#create-vm}

To create and configure VMs, you need a jump server with a graphical user interface and access to the private subnet with a hypervisor connected. 

To make the configuration process easier for you, this tutorial uses a previously leased server, `jump-server`, as the jump server, booted into recovery and diagnostics mode from the [Rescue CD](../../baremetal/operations/servers/rescue-boot.md).

{% include [kvm-console-actions-notice](../_tutorials_includes/opnsense-failover-cluster/kvm-console-actions-notice.md) %}

1. [Start](../../baremetal/operations/servers/rescue-boot.md#boot-up) `jump-server` from the Rescue CD by selecting the default boot option, `Boot SystemRescue using default options`, in the SystemRescue main menu.
1. Run `startx` in the SystemRescue terminal to start the GUI.
1. In the bottom-right corner, click the **Firefox** icon to open the web browser.
1. Download to the server an ISO image of the OS you want installed on your VM.

    {% note info %}

    In this tutorial, your VM will be running [Linux Ubuntu 24.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/24.04/) without a GUI (`Server install image`).

    {% endnote %}

1. In the address bar, enter the hypervisor address, e.g., `https://192.168.1.50/`.
1. On the authentication page, enter `root` for username and use the password you set when installing ESXi.
1. Upload the image of the OS you want installed on your VM to the hypervisor file storage:

    1. In the left-hand main menu, select **Storage**.
    1. In the window that opens, select `datastore1`.
    1. In the top menu, click **Datastore browser** and do the following in the window that opens:

        1. Click **Create directory** and create one named `ISO`.
        1. Select the new `ISO` directory and click **Upload**.
        1. In the window that opens, select the ISO image you downloaded earlier.

            By default, downloaded files are saved to `/Home/Downloads/`.
        1. Wait for the image to upload and click **Close** in the bottom-right corner of the window.
1. Create a virtual machine:

    1. In the left-hand main menu, select **Virtual Machines** and click **Create / Register VM**.
    1. In the **Select creation type** window, select `Create a new virtual machine` and click **Next**.
    1. In the **Select a name and guest OS** window:

        1. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the new VM, e.g., `opnsense-tester-vm`.
        1. In the **Guest OS family** field, select `Linux`.
        1. In the **Guest OS version** field, select `Ubuntu Linux (64-bit)`.
        1. Click **Next**.
    1. In the **Select storage** window, select `datastore1` and click **Next**.
    1. In the **Customize setting** window, configure the **Virtual Hardware** tab as follows:

        1. In the **CPU** field, select the number of vCPUs to allocate to your VM, e.g., `4`.
        1. In the **Memory** field, select the amount of RAM to allocate to your VM, e.g., `8 GB`.
        1. In the **Hard disk 1** field, select the amount of disk space to allocate to your VM, e.g., `50 GB`.
        1. In the **CD/DVD Drive 1** field, select `Datastore ISO file`. In the window that opens, select the image you downloaded earlier.
        1. Leave other settings as they are and click **Next**.
    1. In the **Ready to complete** window, check the settings of the new VM and click **Finish** to create it.
    1. In the left-hand main menu, click **Virtual Machines** and select `opnsense-tester-vm`.
    1. In the window that opens, click ![TriangleRightFill](../../_assets/console-icons/triangle-right-fill.svg) **Power on** or ![TriangleRightFill](../../_assets/console-icons/triangle-right-fill.svg) in the VM preview window.
    1. Click the VM preview window and maximize it.
    1. Go through the operating system installation procedure by selecting the preferred language, keyboard layout, installation type, etc. You can leave all settings at their defaults: this will be enough to test the solution within the scope of this guide.

        On the network settings screen, make sure the VM got a private IP address on the `opnsense-private-subnet-m4` subnet from the range specified in the OPNsense DHCP server settings.
        
        On the **Profile configuration** screen, set up user credentials for accessing the VM.
    1. Once the installation is complete, click **Reboot Now**.

## Test the solution {#test-solution}

To test the solution, we will use a VM created earlier on a server running VMware ESXi.

The successful test criteria are as follows:
* The VM gets an IP address in the local network from the DHCP server created in the OPNsense cluster.
* The VM can connect to the internet through the OPNsense firewall.

### Check whether the client got an IP address from the DHCP server {#check-dhcp-lease}

1. [Connect](../../baremetal/operations/servers/server-kvm.md) to the `opnsense-master` server's KVM console.
1. Log in to the OPNsense server as the `root` user with the password you set when installing the server.
1. Type `8` (the `Shell` option) and press **Enter** to open the OS terminal.
1. Run this command:

    ```bash
    tcpdump -i <interface_ID> -pvn port 67 and port 68
    ```

    Where `<interface_ID>` is the ID of the server network interface connected to `opnsense-private-subnet-m4`, e.g., `igb0`.

    The `tcpdump` command listens on the network interface to visually demonstrate how the DHCP protocol works.

        The `ens160` network interface got the `192.168.1.153` IP address from the DHCP server.
    1. Install `net-tools` and `traceroute`:

        ```bash
        sudo apt install net-tools traceroute
        ```
    1. Check the routing table:

        ```bash
        netstat -rn
        ```

        Result:

        ```text

    1. Ping any external address, e.g., `1.1.1.1`:

        ```bash
        ping -c 3 1.1.1.1
        ```

        Result:

        ```text

    1. Trace the route to any external IP address, e.g., `1.1.1.1`:

        ```bash
        traceroute -n 1.1.1.1
        ```

        Result:

        ```bash

## How to delete the resources you created {#clear-out}

1. [Delete](../../storage/operations/objects/delete.md) the objects you created in the bucket, then [delete](../../storage/operations/buckets/delete.md) the bucket itself.
1. You cannot delete {{ baremetal-name }} servers. Instead, [cancel](../../baremetal/operations/servers/server-lease-cancel.md) the renewal of their lease.
