# Authentication using Google Workspace

With an [identity federation](../../organization/concepts/add-federation.md), you can use [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/) to authenticate users in an organization.

Authentication setup includes the following steps:

1. [Creating and setting up a SAML application in Google Workspace](#gworkspace-settings).
1. [Creating and setting up a federation in {{ org-full-name }}](#yc-settings).
1. [Setting up single sign-on (SSO)](#sso-settings).
1. [Authentication](#test-auth).

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

To follow the steps described in this section, you will need a subscription to Google Workspace services and a verified domain to set up your SAML application for.

## Creating and setting up a SAML application in Google Workspace {#gworkspace-settings}

### Create a SAML application and download a certificate {#create-app}

A SAML application in Google Workspace acts as an identity provider (IdP). Create a SAML application and download a certificate:

1. Open the [Google Workspace Admin Console](https://admin.google.com/).

1. In the left-hand panel, select **Mobile and web applications**.

1. Click **Add** â†’ **Add a custom SAML app**.

1. Enter the name of the app, select the logo, and click **Continue**.

1. In the **Google IdP information** step, the IdP server data is shown. You will need this data when [setting up a federation in {{ org-full-name }}](#yc-settings).

{% note alert %}

Do not close the page where you create an app in Google Workspace: you will get the required configuration data for the **Service provider information** step in [further steps](#add-link).

{% endnote %}

## Creating and setting up a federation in {{ org-full-name }} {#yc-settings}

### Create a federation {#create-federation}

To create a federation:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- {{ cloud-center }} UI {#cloud-center}

  1. Go to [{{ org-full-name }}]({{ link-org-cloud-center }}).

  1. In the left-hand panel, select ![icon-federation](../../_assets/console-icons/vector-square.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.pages.federations }}**.

  1. Click ![Circles3Plus](../../_assets/console-icons/circles-3-plus.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.form.federation.action.create }}** in the top-right corner of the page. In the window that opens:

      1. Give your federation a name. It must be unique within the folder.

      1. You can also add a description, if required.

      1. In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.entity.federation.field.cookieMaxAge }}** field, specify the time before the browser asks the user to re-authenticate.
  
      1. In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.entity.federation.field.issuer }}** field, enter the link from the **Object ID** field on the Google Workspace **Google IdP information** page. The link should have the following format:

          ```text
          https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2?idpid=<SAML_app_ID>
          ```

      1. In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.entity.federation.field.ssoUrl }}** field, paste the link copied from the **SSO URL** field on the Google Workspace **Google IdP information** page. The link should have the following format:

          ```text
          https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/idp?idpid=<SAML_app_ID>
          ```

          {% include [ssourl_protocol](../../_includes/organization/ssourl_protocol.md) %}

      1. Enable **{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.entity.federation.field.autocreateUsers }}** to add authenticated users to your organization automatically. If you do not enable this option, you will need to [manually add](../../organization/operations/add-account.md#add-user-sso) your federated users.

          {% include [fed-users-note](../../_includes/organization/fed-users-note.md) %}

      1. {% include [forceauthn-option-enable](../../_includes/organization/forceauthn-option-enable.md) %}

      1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.form.federation.create.action.create }}**.

    {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

    {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

    1. View the description of the create federation command:

        ```bash
        yc organization-manager federation saml create --help
        ```

    1. Create a federation:

        ```bash
        yc organization-manager federation saml create --name my-federation \
          --organization-id <organization_ID> \
          --auto-create-account-on-login \
          --cookie-max-age 12h \
          --issuer "https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2?idpid=<SAML_app_ID>" \
          --sso-url "https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/idp?idpid=<SAML_app_ID>" \
          --sso-binding POST \
          --force-authn
        ```

        Where:

        * `--name`: Federation name. It must be unique within the folder.
        
        * `--organization-id`: [Organization ID](../../organization/operations/organization-get-id.md).

        * `--auto-create-account-on-login`: Flag enabling the automatic creation of new cloud users after authenticating on the IdP server. 
        This option makes it easier to create users; however, users created this way will not be able to do anything with cloud resources. This does not apply to the resources for which roles are assigned to the `All users` or `All authenticated users` [public group](../../iam/concepts/access-control/public-group.md).

            If this option is off, users not added to the organization will not be able to log in to the management console, even if authenticated on your server. In this case, you can manage a list of users allowed to use {{ yandex-cloud }} resources.

        * `--cookie-max-age`: Time before the browser asks the user to re-authenticate.
        
        * `--issuer`: ID of the IdP server to use for authentication.

            Use the link provided in the **Object ID** field on the **Google IdP information** page in Google Workspace. This is a link in the format:

            ```text
            https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2?idpid=<SAML_app_ID>
            ```

        * `--sso-url`: URL of the page the browser has to redirect the user to for authentication.

            Use the link from the **SSO URL** field on the Google Workspace **Google IdP information** page. The link should have the following format:

            ```text
            https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/idp?idpid=<SAML_app_ID>
            ```

            {% include [ssourl_protocol](../../_includes/organization/ssourl_protocol.md) %}

        * `--sso-binding`: Specify the single sign-on binding type. Most identity providers support the `POST` binding type.

        * {% include [forceauthn-cli-enable](../../_includes/organization/forceauth-cli-enable.md) %}

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

  {% include [terraform-install](../../_includes/terraform-install.md) %}

  1. Describe the federation parameters in the configuration file.

      Configuration file structure example:

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_organizationmanager_saml_federation" federation {
        name            = "my-federation"
        organization_id = "<organization_ID>"
        auto_create_account_on_login = "true"
        issuer          = "https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2?idpid=<SAML_app_ID>"
        sso_url         = "https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/idp?idpid=<SAML_app_ID>"
        sso_binding     = "POST"
        security_settings {
          encrypted_assertions = "true"
        }
      }
      ```

      Where:

      * `name`: Federation name. It must be unique within the folder.
      * `description`: Federation description.
      * `organization_id`: [Organization ID](../../organization/operations/organization-get-id.md). 
      * `labels`: Set of key/value label pairs assigned to the federation. This is an optional parameter.
      * `issuer`: ID of the IdP server to use for authentication.

          Use the link from the **Object ID** field on the Google Workspace **Google IdP information** page. The link should have the following format:

          ```text
          https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2?idpid=<SAML_app_ID>
          ```

      * `sso_binding`: Specify the single sign-on binding type. Most identity providers support the `POST` binding type.
      * `sso_url`: URL of the page the browser has to redirect the user to for authentication.

          Use this as the destination when copying the link from the **SSO URL** field on the Google Workspace **Google IdP information** page. The link should have the following format:

          ```text
          https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/idp?idpid=<SAML_app_ID>
          ```

          {% include [ssourl_protocol](../../_includes/organization/ssourl_protocol.md) %}

      * `cookie_max_age`: Time in seconds before the browser asks the user to re-authenticate. The default value is `8 hours`. 
      * `auto_create_account_on_login`: Flag enabling the automatic creation of new cloud users after authenticating on the IdP server. 
      This option makes it easier to create users; however, users created this way will not be able to do anything with cloud resources. This does not apply to the resources for which roles are assigned to the `All users` or `All authenticated users` [public group](../../iam/concepts/access-control/public-group.md).

          If this option is off, users not added to the organization will not be able to log in to the management console, even if authenticated on your server. In this case, you can manage a list of users allowed to use {{ yandex-cloud }} resources.

      * `case_insensitive_name_ids`: Toggles username case sensitivity.
          If this option is enabled, the IDs of federated user names will be case-insensitive.
      * `security_settings`: Federation security settings: 

          * {% include [encrypted-assertions-tf](../../_includes/organization/encrypted-assertions-tf.md) %}

          * {% include [force-authn-tf](../../_includes/organization/force-authn-tf.md) %}

      {% include [organizationmanager_saml_federation-tf](../../_includes/organization/organizationmanager_saml_federation-tf.md) %}

  1. Make sure the configuration files are correct.

      1. In the command line, navigate to the directory where you created the configuration file.
      1. Run a check using this command:

          ```bash
          terraform plan
          ```

      If the configuration is described correctly, the terminal displays the federation parameters. If the configuration contains any errors, {{ TF }} will show them. 

  1. Create a federation.

      1. If the configuration does not contain any errors, run this command:

          ```bash
          terraform apply
          ```

      1. Confirm you want to create a federation.

      This will create a federation in the specified organization. You can check the new federation and its settings in the organization's [{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.pages.federations }}]({{ link-org-federations }}) section.

- API {#api}

    1. Create a file with the request body, e.g., `body.json`:

        ```json
        {
          "name": "my-federation",
          "organizationId": "<organization_ID>",
          "autoCreateAccountOnLogin": true,
          "cookieMaxAge":"43200s",
          "issuer": "https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2?idpid=<SAML_app_ID>",

        Where:
        
        * `name`: Federation name. It must be unique within the folder.

        * `organizationId`: [Organization ID](../../organization/operations/organization-get-id.md). 

        * `autoCreateAccountOnLogin`: Flag enabling the automatic creation of new cloud users after authenticating on the IdP server. 
        This option makes it easier to create users; however, users created this way will not be able to do anything with cloud resources. This does not apply to the resources for which roles are assigned to the `All users` or `All authenticated users` [public group](../../iam/concepts/access-control/public-group.md).

            If this option is off, users not added to the organization will not be able to log in to the management console, even if authenticated on your server. In this case, you can manage a list of users allowed to use {{ yandex-cloud }} resources.

        * `cookieMaxAge`: Time before the browser asks the user to re-authenticate.
        
        * `issuer`: ID of the IdP server to use for authentication.

            Use the link from the **Object ID** field on the Google Workspace **Google IdP information** page. The link should have the following format:

            ```text
            https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2?idpid=<SAML_app_ID>
            ```
        * `ssoUrl`: URL of the page the browser has to redirect the user to for authentication.

            Use this as the destination when copying the link from the **SSO URL** field on the Google Workspace **Google IdP information** page. The link should have the following format:

            ```text

    1. {% include [include](../../_includes/iam/create-federation-curl.md) %}

{% endlist %}

### Add certificates {#add-certificate}

While authenticating, the {{ org-name }} service should be able to verify the IdP server certificate. To enable this, download a certificate from the open Google Workspace **Google IdP Information** page and add it to the created federation:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- {{ cloud-center }} UI {#cloud-center}

  {% include [add-cert-to-fed](../../_includes/organization/add-cert-to-fed.md) %}

- CLI {#cli}

  {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  1. View the description of the add certificate command:

      ```bash
      yc organization-manager federation saml certificate create --help
      ```

  1. Add a federation certificate by specifying the certificate file path:

      ```bash
      yc organization-manager federation saml certificate create --federation-id <federation_ID> \
        --name "my-certificate" \
        --certificate-file certificate.pem
      ```

- API {#api}

  Use the [create](../../organization/saml/api-ref/Certificate/create.md) method for the [Certificate](../../organization/saml/api-ref/Certificate/index.md) resource:

  1. Create a request body. In the `data` property, specify the contents of the certificate:

      ```json
      {
        "federationId": "<federation_ID>",
        "name": "my-certificate",
        "data": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE..."
      }
      ```

  1. Send the request to add the certificate:

      ```bash
      export IAM_TOKEN=CggaAT********
      curl \
        --request POST \
        --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}" \
        --data '@body.json' \
        "https://organization-manager.{{ api-host }}/organization-manager/v1/saml/certificates"
      ```

{% endlist %}

{% include [federation-certificates-note](../../_includes/organization/federation-certificates-note.md) %}


## Setting up single sign-on (SSO) {#sso-settings}

### Specify the redirect URL {#add-link}

Once you have created a federation, complete the creation of the SAML application in Google Workspace:

1. Go back to the SAML app creation page's **Google IdP information** step and click **Continue**.

1. In the **Service provider information** step, specify information about {{ yandex-cloud }} that acts as a service provider:

    * In the **ACS URL** and **Object ID** fields, enter the ACS URL to redirect users to after successful authentication.

      {% cut "How to get a federation ID" %}
   
      {% include [get-federation-id](../../_includes/organization/get-federation-id.md) %}
   
      {% endcut %}

      
      {% cut "How to get the federation ACS URL" %}

      {% include [get-acs-url](../../_includes/organization/get-acs-url.md) %}

      {% endcut %}

    
    * Enable **Signed Response**.

1. Click **Continue**.

    
    {% note tip %}

    To enable the user to contact {{ yandex-cloud }} technical support from the [management console]({{ link-console-support }}), in the **Mapping attributes** step, click **Add new mappings** and configure the provision of attributes:
    * **Primary email**.
    * **First name**.
    * **Last name**.

    User attributes supported by the {{ org-full-name }} services are listed in the [User attributes mapping](#claims-mapping) section.

    {% endnote %}


1. To complete the creation of the app, click **Ready**.

### Add users {#add-users}

1. On the app page, under **User access**, click **Disabled for everyone**. 

1. In the page that opens, select who can authenticate with this identity federation:

    * To enable access for all federation users, select **ON for everyone**.

    * To enable access for an individual organizational unit, select the unit from the list on the left and configure the service status for this unit. The child units inherit access settings from the parent units by default.

1. Click **Save**.

### Mapping user attributes {#claims-mapping}

User data | Comment | Application Attributes
------------------- | ----------- | -------------------
Unique user ID | Required attribute. Using an email address is recommended. | **Name ID** field in service provider settings

### Add users to your organization {#add-users-to-org}

If you did not enable the **{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.entity.federation.field.autocreateUsers }}** option when [creating the federation](#yc-settings), you will have to add federated users to your organization manually.

To do this, you will need user name IDs. They are returned by the IdP server together with a response confirming successful authentication.

{% include [auto-create-users](../../_includes/organization/auto-create-users.md) %}

A user can be added by the organization administrator (the `organization-manager.admin` role) or owner (the `organization-manager.organizations.owner` role). To learn how to grant a role to a user, see [Roles](../../organization/security/index.md#add-role).

{% include [console-user-access](../../_includes/organization/console-user-access.md) %}

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- {{ cloud-center }} UI {#cloud-center}

  {% include [add-users-to-fed](../../_includes/organization/add-users-to-fed.md) %}

- CLI {#cli}

  {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  1. View the description of the add user command:

      ```bash
      yc organization-manager federation saml add-user-accounts --help
      ```

  1. Add users by listing their name IDs separated by a comma:

      ```bash
      yc organization-manager federation saml add-user-accounts --id <federation_ID> \
        --name-ids=alice@example.com,bob@example.com,charlie@example.com
      ```

      Where:

      * `--id`: Federation ID.
      * `--name-ids`: Name IDs of users.

- API {#api}

  To add identity federation users to the cloud:

  1. Create a file with the request body, e.g., `body.json`. In the request body, specify the array of name IDs of users you want to add:

      ```json
      {
        "nameIds": [
          "alice@example.com",
          "bob@example.com",
          "charlie@example.com"
        ]
      }
      ```
  1.  Send the request by specifying the federation ID in the parameters:

      ```bash
      curl \
        --request POST \
        --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
        --data '@body.json' \
        https://organization-manager.{{ api-host }}/organization-manager/v1/saml/federations/<federation_ID>:addUserAccounts
      ```

{% endlist %}

## Authentication {#test-auth}

When you finish configuring the server, test that everything works properly:

1. Open your browser in guest or private browsing mode.

1. Use this URL to log in to the management console:

   ```text
   {{ link-console-main }}/federations/<federation_ID>
   ```

   {% cut "How to get a federation ID" %}

   {% include [get-federation-id](../../_includes/organization/get-federation-id.md) %}

   {% endcut %}

   The browser will forward you to the Google authentication page.

1. Enter your credentials and click **Sign in**.

On successful authentication, the IdP server will redirect you back to the ACS URL you specified in the Google Workspace settings and then to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) home page. In the top-right corner, you can see that you are logged in to the console as a federated user.

#### What's next {#what-is-next}
