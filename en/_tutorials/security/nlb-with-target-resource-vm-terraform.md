# Migrating services from an NLB with VMs as targets to an L7 ALB using {{ TF }}


To migrate a service from a network load balancer to an L7 load balancer using {{ TF }}:

1. [See the service migration recommendations](#recommendations).
1. [Create your infrastructure](#deploy). At this step, you will associate the {{ sws-name }} profile with a virtual host of the L7 load balancer.
1. [Test the L7 load balancer](#test).
1. [Migrate user traffic from the network load balancer to the L7 load balancer](#migration-nlb-to-alb).

## Service migration recommendations {#recommendations}

{% include [recommendations](../_tutorials_includes/migration-from-nlb-to-alb/recommendations.md) %}

## Create your infrastructure {#deploy}

1. {% include [terraform-install-without-setting](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/install-without-setting.md) %}
1. {% include [terraform-authentication](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/authentication.md) %}
1. {% include [terraform-setting](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/setting.md) %}
1. {% include [terraform-configure-provider](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/configure-provider.md) %}

1. Download the configuration file to the same working directory based on the protocol you are using:
    * `HTTP`: [alb-vm-http.tf](https://github.com/yandex-cloud-examples/yc-nlb-alb-vm-migration/blob/main/alb-vm-http.tf) configuration file
    * `HTTPS`: [alb-vm-https.tf](https://github.com/yandex-cloud-examples/yc-nlb-alb-vm-migration/blob/main/alb-vm-https.tf) configuration file

    These files describe:

    * [Subnets](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet) for the L7 load balancer.
    * [Security group](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) for the L7 load balancer.
    * Static address for the L7 load balancer.
    * Importing a TLS certificate to {{ certificate-manager-name }} (if using `HTTPS`).
    * {{ sws-name }} profile.
    * Target group, backend group, and HTTP router for the L7 load balancer.
    * L7 load balancer.

1. In the configuration file, set the following custom properties:

    1. Specify the values for the following variables:

        * `domain_name`: Your service domain name.
        * `network_id`: ID of the network containing the VMs from the network load balancer's target group.
        * `certificate` (for `HTTPS`): Path to the self-signed custom certificate.
        * `private_key` (for `HTTPS`): Path to the private key file.

    1. For the `yandex_alb_target_group` resource, add as many `target` sections as there are virtual machines in your network load balancer's target group.

        ```hcl
        resource "yandex_alb_target_group" "alb-target-group" {
          ...
          target {
            subnet_id    = "<subnet_ID>"
            ip_address   = "<VM_1_internal_IP_address>"
          }
          target {
            subnet_id    = "<subnet_ID>"
            ip_address   = "<VM_2_internal_IP_address>"
          }
          ...
          target {
            subnet_id    = "<subnet_ID>"
            ip_address   = "<VM_N_internal_IP_address>"
          }
        }
        ```

        Where:

        * `subnet_id`: ID of the subnet hosting the VM.
        * `ip_address`: Internal IP address of the VM specified in your network load balancerâ€™s target group.

    1. If your service needs one and the same backend resource processing requests within a single user session, enable [session affinity](../../application-load-balancer/concepts/backend-group.md#session-affinity) for the backend group by uncommenting this section for the `yandex_alb_backend_group` resource:

        ```hcl
        session_affinity {
          connection {
            source_ip = true
          }
        }
        ```

1. Validate your {{ TF }} configuration files using this command:

    ```bash
    terraform validate
    ```

    {{ TF }} will display any configuration errors detected in your files.

1. Create the required infrastructure:

    {% include [terraform-apply](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}

    {% include [explore-resources](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/explore-resources.md) %}

1. In the management console, select the folder where you created the L7 load balancer.
1. Select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_application-load-balancer }}**.
1. Wait until the L7 load balancer goes `Active`.
1. Specify the autoscaling settings in the L7 load balancer:

    1. In the management console, click the load balancer's name.
    1. Click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.edit }}**.
    1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.alb.section_autoscale-settings }}**, set the [resource unit](../../application-load-balancer/concepts/application-load-balancer.md#lcu-scaling) limit.
    1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.save }}**.

## Test the L7 load balancer {#test}

1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), navigate to the new L7 load balancer and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.alb.label_healthchecks }}** on the left. Make sure you get `HEALTHY` for all the L7 load balancer's health checks.

1. {% include [test](../_tutorials_includes/migration-from-nlb-to-alb/test.md) %}

## Migrate user traffic from the network load balancer to the L7 load balancer {#migration-nlb-to-alb}

Select one of these migration options:

* [Keep the public IP address for your service](#save-public-ip).
* [Do not keep the public IP address for your service](#not-save-public-ip).

### Keep the public IP address for your service {#save-public-ip}

1. If your external network load balancer uses a dynamic public IP address, [convert it to a static one](../../vpc/operations/set-static-ip.md).

1. [Delete the listener](../../network-load-balancer/operations/listener-remove.md) in the network load balancer to release the static public IP address. This will make your service unavailable through the network load balancer.

1. In the L7 load balancer, assign to the listener the public IP address previously used by the network load balancer:

    1. Open the configuration file you used to create the L7 load balancer (`alb-vm-http.tf` or `alb-vm-https.tf`).

    1. In the load balancer description, update the `address` parameter under `listener.endpoint.address.external_ipv4_address`:

        ```hcl
        resource "yandex_alb_load_balancer" "<load_balancer_name>" {
          ...
          listener {
            ...
            endpoint {
              address {
                external_ipv4_address {
                  address = <service_public_IP_address>
                }
              }
              ports = [ <service_port> ]
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        Where `address` is the public IP address the network load balancer used previously.

    1. Apply the changes:

        {% include [terraform-validate-plan-apply](../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/terraform-validate-plan-apply.md) %}

1. After the IP address changes, your service will again be available through the L7 load balancer. Monitor the L7 load balancer's user traffic on the [load balancer statistics](../../application-load-balancer/operations/application-load-balancer-get-stats.md) charts.

1. Delete the now free static public IP address you selected when creating the L7 load balancer:

    1. Open the configuration file you used to create the L7 load balancer (`alb-vm-http.tf` or `alb-vm-https.tf`).

    1. Delete the `yandex_vpc_address` resource description from the file:

        ```hcl
        resource "yandex_vpc_address" "static-address" {
          description = "Static public IP address for the Application Load Balancer"
          name        = "alb-static-address"
          external_ipv4_address {
            zone_id                  = "ru-central1-a"
            ddos_protection_provider = "qrator"
          }
        }
        ```

    1. Apply the changes:

        {% include [terraform-validate-plan-apply](../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/terraform-validate-plan-apply.md) %}

1. Optionally, [delete the network load balancer](../../network-load-balancer/operations/load-balancer-delete.md) after migrating user traffic to the L7 load balancer.

### Do not keep the public IP address for your service {#not-save-public-ip}

{% include [vm-not-save-public-ip](../_tutorials_includes/migration-from-nlb-to-alb/vm-not-save-public-ip.md) %}
