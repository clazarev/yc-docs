# Creating an assistant for RAG with query rephrasing

In {{ assistant-api }}, you can enable an additional rephrasing model to make search index queries more accurate. Rephrasing will correct errors and typos and help you out if the response requires massive volumes of indexed data and heavily relies on the conversation context.

## Getting started {#before-begin}

To use the examples:

{% list tabs group=programming_language %}

- SDK {#sdk}

  {% include [sdk-before-begin-assistants](../../../_includes/ai-studio/sdk-before-begin-assistants.md) %}

{% endlist %}

## Create an assistant {#create-assistant}

In this example, we are going to use the [tour information scenario](./create-with-searchindex.md) to show how to create an assistant with a search index and an active rephrasing model. 

{% list tabs group=programming_language %}

- SDK {#sdk}

  1. {% include [download-context-file-step](../../../_includes/ai-studio/assistants/download-context-file-step.md) %}
  1. Create a file named `rephraser.py` and paste the following code into it providing the folder ID and authentication credentials:

     {% include [searchindex-assistant](../../../_includes/ai-studio/examples/rephraser-assistant-sdk.md) %}

     Where:
   
     * `<folder_ID>`: [ID of the folder](../../../resource-manager/operations/folder/get-id.md) the [service account](../../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) was created in.
     * `<API_key>`: Service account [API key](../../../iam/concepts/authorization/api-key.md) required for [authentication in the API](../../api-ref/authentication.md).
     
  1. Run the file you created:

      ```bash
      python3 rephraser.py
      ```

      {% cut "Result" %}
