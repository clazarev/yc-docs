# How to build a chat with {{ gpt-lite }} or {{ gpt-pro }}

{{ gpt-lite }} and {{ gpt-pro }} models do not retain the context of previous messages, so to have a continuous dialog with a selected model, you need to save the message history on your device and send it each time you are addressing the model. The [chat](../../concepts/generation/index.md) available in the management console consists of multiple prompts where the context of each new text query includes the model's responses to previous ones. The text generation models are subject to context length [limits](../../concepts/limits.md).

{% note tip %}

Use {{ assistant-api }} to create a chat with the model. For an example of a chat implemented using assistants and threads, see the [{#T}](../assistant/create.md) guide.

{% endnote %}

To create a chat with a model in your application and avoid delays in responses, send prompts in [synchronous](../../concepts/index.md#working-mode) mode using the [completion](../../text-generation/api-ref/TextGeneration/completion.md) method or [{{ ml-sdk-full-name }}](../../sdk/index.md).

## Getting started {#before-begin}

{% list tabs group=programming_language %}

- SDK {#sdk}

  To use the examples of requests using SDK:

  {% include [sdk-before-begin-ai-langmodel-user](../../../_includes/ai-studio/sdk-before-begin-ai-langmodel-user.md) %}

- cURL {#curl}

  {% include notitle [ai-before-beginning](../../../_includes/ai-studio/yandexgpt/ai-before-beginning.md) %}

  {% include [curl](../../../_includes/curl.md) %}

- Python {#python}

  {% include notitle [ai-before-beginning](../../../_includes/ai-studio/yandexgpt/ai-before-beginning.md) %}

{% endlist %}

## Build a chat {#develop-chat}

{% list tabs group=programming_language %}

- SDK {#sdk}

  1. Create a file named `create-chat.py` and paste the following code into it:

      ```python
      #!/usr/bin/env python3

      from __future__ import annotations
      from yandex_cloud_ml_sdk import YCloudML

      messages = [
          {
              "role": "system",
              "text": "You are a smart assistant",
          },
          {
              "role": "user",
              "text": "Hi! What fields of science did Albert Einstein study?",
          },
      ]

      def main():
          sdk = YCloudML(
              folder_id="<folder_ID>",
              auth="<API_key>",
          )

          result = (
              sdk.models.completions("yandexgpt").configure(temperature=0.6).run(messages)
          )

          for alternative in result:
              print(alternative)

      if __name__ == "__main__":
          main()
      ```

      Where:

      {% note info %}

      {% include [sdk-input-format](../../../_includes/ai-studio/sdk-input-format.md) %}

      {% endnote %}

      {% include [the-messages-parameter](../../../_includes/ai-studio/yandexgpt/the-messages-parameter.md) %}

      {% include [sdk-code-legend](../../../_includes/ai-studio/examples/sdk-code-legend.md) %}

      {% include [yandexgpt-model-version-sdk-info](../../../_includes/ai-studio/yandexgpt/yandexgpt-model-version-sdk-info.md) %}

  1. Run the created file:

      ```bash
      python3 create-chat.py
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      Alternative(role='assistant', text='Albert Einstein studied **physics** and **mathematics**. His work had a major influence on both fields as well as on theoretical physics in general.', status=<AlternativeStatus.FINAL: 3>)
      ```

  1. Add the model's response to the previous request and the user's new question to the end of the `messages` array in the `create-chat.py` file:

      ```python
      ...
      messages = [
          {
              "role": "system",
              "text": "You are a smart assistant",
          },
          {
              "role": "user",
              "text": "Hi! What fields of science did Albert Einstein study?",
          },
          {
              "role": "assistant",
              "text": ""”Albert Einstein studied **physics** and **mathematics**. 
      His work had a major influence on both fields 
      as well as on theoretical physics in general.""",
          },
          {
              "role": "user",
              "text": "What important discoveries did he make?",
          },
      ]
      ...
      ```

  1. Execute the file again:

      ```bash
      python3 create-chat.py
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      Alternative(role='assistant', text='Albert Einstein is one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century. Here are some of his important discoveries:\n* **Special theory of relativity.** Einstein has formulated the special theory of relativity, which describes motion, laws of mechanics, and spatiotemporal relationships at random velocities less than the speed of light in vacuum.\n* **General theory of relativity.** This theory describes gravity as the curvature of space-time and explains many astronomical phenomena, such as gravity waves and black holes.\n* **Photoelectric effect.** For this discovery, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics.

It explains how mass can be transformed into energy and vice versa.', status=<AlternativeStatus.FINAL: 3>)
      ```

  1. Continue expanding the request context with the received responses and user questions:

      ```python
      ...
      messages = [
          {
              "role": "system",
              "text": "You are a smart assistant",
          },
          {
              "role": "user",
              "text": "Hi! What fields of science did Albert Einstein study?",
          },
          {
              "role": "assistant",
              "text": ""”Albert Einstein studied **physics** and **mathematics**. 
      His work had a major influence on both fields 
      as well as on theoretical physics in general.""",
          },
          {
              "role": "user",
              "text": "What important discoveries did he make?",
          },
          {
              "role": "assistant",
              "text": """Albert Einstein is one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century.

          },
          {
              "role": "user",
              "text": "Make it shorter",
          },
      ]
      ...
      ```

      Result:

      ```

- cURL {#curl}

  1. Prepare a model request file, e.g., `body.json`:
  
      {% include notitle [create-chat-body-json-part](../../../_includes/ai-studio/yandexgpt/create-chat-body-json-part.md) %}

  1. Send a request to the model:

      ```bash
      export FOLDER_ID=<folder_ID>
      export IAM_TOKEN=<IAM_token>
      curl \
        --request POST \
        --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}" \
        --header "x-folder-id: ${FOLDER_ID}" \
        --data "@<path_to_JSON_file>" \
        "https://llm.{{ api-host }}/foundationModels/v1/completion"
      ```

      Where:

      * `FOLDER_ID`: ID of the folder for which your account has the `{{ roles-yagpt-user }}` role or higher.
      * `IAM_TOKEN`: Your account's IAM token.

  1. In response to your request, the model will return the generated text:

      {% include notitle [create-chat-step-3](../../../_includes/ai-studio/yandexgpt/create-chat-step-3.md) %}

  1. Add the `message` record value from the model's response to the previous request and the user's new question to the end of the `messages` array in the request file:

      {% include notitle [create-chat-step-4](../../../_includes/ai-studio/yandexgpt/create-chat-step-4.md) %}

  1. Send a new request to the model by repeating Step 2 of this guide. In response to your request, the model will again return the generated text:

      {% include notitle [create-chat-step-5](../../../_includes/ai-studio/yandexgpt/create-chat-step-5.md) %}

  1. Continue expanding the request context with the received responses and user questions:

      {% include notitle [create-chat-step-6](../../../_includes/ai-studio/yandexgpt/create-chat-step-6.md) %}

- Python {#python}

  1. Prepare a model request file, e.g., `body.json`:
  
      {% include notitle [create-chat-body-json-part](../../../_includes/ai-studio/yandexgpt/create-chat-body-json-part.md) %}

  1. Send a request to the model:

      1. Create a file named `index.py` and add the following code to it:

         ```python
         import requests
         import json
         import os

         def gpt(auth_headers):

             url = 'https://llm.api.cloud.yandex.net/foundationModels/v1/completion'

             with open('body.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                 data = json.dumps(json.load(f))
             resp = requests.post(url, headers=auth_headers, data=data)

             if resp.status_code != 200:
                 raise RuntimeError(
                     'Invalid response received: code: {}, message: {}'.format(
                         {resp.status_code}, {resp.text}
                     )
                 )

             return resp.text

         if __name__ == "__main__":
             if os.getenv('IAM_TOKEN') is not None:
                 iam_token = os.environ['IAM_TOKEN']
                 headers = {
                     'Authorization': f'Bearer {iam_token}',
                 }
             elif os.getenv('API_KEY') is not None:
                 api_key = os.environ['API_KEY']
                 headers = {
                     'Authorization': f'Api-Key {api_key}',
                 }
             else:
                 print ('Please save either an IAM token or an API key into a corresponding `IAM_TOKEN` or `API_KEY` environment variable.')
                 exit()

             print(gpt(headers))
         ```

      1. Save the authentication data to the environment variable:

         **Authentication with an IAM token:**

         ```bash
         export IAM_TOKEN=<IAM_token>
         ```

         **Authentication with an API key (for service accounts only):**

         ```bash
         export API_KEY=<API_key>
         ```

      1. Run the created file:

         ```bash
         python index.py
         ```

  1. In response to your request, the model will return the generated text:

      {% include notitle [create-chat-step-3](../../../_includes/ai-studio/yandexgpt/create-chat-step-3.md) %}

  1. Add the `message` record value from the model's response to the previous request and the user's new question to the end of the `messages` array in the request file:

      {% include notitle [create-chat-step-4](../../../_includes/ai-studio/yandexgpt/create-chat-step-4.md) %}

  1. Send a new request to the model by repeating Step `2.3` of this guide. In response to your request, the model will again return the generated text:

      {% include notitle [create-chat-step-5](../../../_includes/ai-studio/yandexgpt/create-chat-step-5.md) %}

  1. Continue expanding the request context with the received responses and user questions:

      {% include notitle [create-chat-step-6](../../../_includes/ai-studio/yandexgpt/create-chat-step-6.md) %}
