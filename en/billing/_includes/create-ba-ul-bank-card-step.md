Optionally, if you selected to pay with a credit or debit card, open the **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing_account.create-account-wizard.label_step-payment_title }}** page and add your corporate card to the new billing account:

{% include [pin-card-data](../../_includes/billing/pin-card-data.md) %}

* Confirm that the card is a corporate one and you are authorized to use it.

If the user account already has bank cards linked to it, you can select one of them without adding a new one.

{% include [payment-card-types](../../_includes/billing/payment-card-types-business.md) %}

{% include [payment-card-validation](../../_includes/billing/payment-card-validation.md) %}

Once you have added your card, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing_account.cloud-billing-account.label_wizard-next }}**.
