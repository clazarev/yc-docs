# Viewing a cost breakdown report

A cost breakdown helps you understand exactly where your money is going, streamline expenses, and plan your budget more precisely.

You can obtain cost breakdowns in several ways:

* [Viewing breakdowns in the management console](./check-charges.md)
* [Viewing breakdowns in your {{ datalens-full-name }}](./dashboard.md)
* [One-time export of cost breakdowns](./get-folder-report.md#single-time-download)
* [Scheduled (recurring) export of cost breakdowns](./get-folder-report.md#set-up-regular-download)

You can also [search your cost breakdowns for specific data](./query-integration.md) using queries in {{ yq-full-name }}.
