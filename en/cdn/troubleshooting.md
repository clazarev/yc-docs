# Troubleshooting in {{ cdn-name }}

Below is the list of common issues with {{ cdn-name }} and ways to fix them.

## The CDN responds to file requests with 3xx codes (redirect) {#responses-3xx}

Make sure to specify the following [resource](concepts/resource.md) settings:

* Protocol used by the origins as the primary one (HTTP or HTTPS). If origins redirect requests from `http` URIs to `https` URIs, select HTTPS for the resource, and vice versa.
* `Host` HTTP header value to which origins respond without redirects. 
  
  > For example, if the header value is set to `www.example.com`, and origins redirect requests with this value to `example.com`, change the value in the settings to `example.com`.

## The CDN responds to file requests with 4xx codes (client error) {#responses-4xx}

Make sure that:

* The resource settings allow end-user access to content.
* Origins return files in response to direct requests, bypassing the CDN.
* Origins allow and correctly process requests that match the resource settings:

  * Over the specified protocol: HTTP or HTTPS.
  * With the specified value of the `Host` HTTP header and other headers. 

## The CDN responds to file requests with 5xx codes (server error) {#responses-5xx}

{% include [ipv4-note](../_includes/cdn/ipv4-note.md) %}

Make sure that:

* Origins respond to CDN server requests within 5 seconds.
* Origins allow and correctly process requests that match the resource settings:

  * Over the specified protocol: HTTP or HTTPS.
  * With the specified value of the `Host` HTTP header and other headers. 
  
Also, check the {{ cdn-name }} status [here](https://status.yandex.cloud/en/dashboard?service=cloud%20cdn).

## Updated settings failed to apply to the resource {#changes-not-applied}

{% include [after-changes-tip](../_includes/cdn/after-changes-tip.md) %}

## The CDN resource has the Not active status, preventing content delivery to users {#resource-not-active}

Resources can show as `Not active` due to receiving no user requests for 90 days or being deactivated manually. To make them active again, [enable](operations/resources/configure-basics.md) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.cdn.field_access }}** in the basic resource settings. To enable or disable resources, you need the `cdn.editor` role or higher.

## Unable to configure the TLS certificate {#tls-certificate}

{% note info %}

We no longer support the _automatic_ issue of Let's EncryptÂ® certificates for CDN resources.

{% endnote %}

{% include [certificate-usage](../_includes/cdn/certificate-usage.md) %}

Below is an example of a CLI error you receive when the certificate and the CDN resource reside in different folders:

```bash
ERROR: operation (id=bcdb6qaiw8mb********) failed: rpc error: code = InvalidArgument desc = folder ids of user and certificate don't match; operation-id: bcdb6qaiw8mb********
```

## The CDN sends compressed files to users who do not request compressed content {#compressed-files}

{{ cdn-name }} may send compressed files even if a user does not request compressed content. This may happen in the following cases:

1. First request from the client for the file not yet in the CDN cache had the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header. The same header is provided to the [origin](./concepts/origins.md).
1. The origin transfers the compressed file to the CDN cache but does not add the `Vary: Accept-Encoding` header. For example, this happens if you set an [{{ objstorage-name }} bucket](../storage/concepts/bucket.md) as the origin.

In this case, the CDN cache saves the compressed file, which all clients will receive. Also, it is irrelevant whether their devices support compression or whether they add the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to their requests.

To avoid this, [enable file compression](./operations/resources/enable-compression.md). This way, Cloud CDN will always request non-compressed content from the origin, and if the client request has the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header, it will compress files on its own without sending the header to the origin.
