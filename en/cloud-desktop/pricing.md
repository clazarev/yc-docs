## What goes into the cost of using {{ cloud-desktop-name }} {#rules}

The {{ cloud-desktop-name }} usage cost includes:

* Computing resources:
  * Number of vCPUs
  * Amount of RAM
* Disk type and size
* Amount of outgoing traffic

{% include [pricing-gb-size](../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}

The monthly prices are based on 720 hours per month.

### Using computing resources {#use-resources}

The cost of allocated computing resources is calculated based on how long the desktops were used: from when they get the `CREATING` (if being created) or `STARTING` (if starting) status until they are completely stopped. You are not charged for the time during which the desktops were stopped.

A desktop starts automatically once it is created.

### Using disks {#use-storage}

You are charged for disks whether the desktops are running or not.
