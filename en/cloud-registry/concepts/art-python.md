# Python artifact

_Python artifact_ is a package file containing a [Python](https://www.python.org/) code archive, metadata, dependencies, and other resources. Examples of artifacts:

* [whl (wheel)](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/)
* [tar (tarball)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing))

Python artifacts are used to distribute libraries, tools, and components you can integrate into your Python projects. [PyPI](https://docs.pypi.org/) is the official repository for distributing Python artifacts.
