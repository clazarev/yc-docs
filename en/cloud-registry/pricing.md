{% include [pricing-gb-size](../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}

Storage usage is measured in GB per hour. The amount of data stored for a month is calculated as the average value based on granulated per-second data. The minimum billing unit is 1 hour of storing 1 MB of data.

{% note warning %}

If multiple [Docker images](concepts/docker-image.md) in the same registry use the same layers, you are not charged repeatedly for storing each reused layer. A layer's [digest](concepts/docker-image.md#version) indicates whether the layer is unique.
