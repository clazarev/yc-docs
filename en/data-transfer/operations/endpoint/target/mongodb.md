# Transferring data to a {{ MG }}/{{ SD }} (Managed Service for MongoDB) target endpoint


{{ data-transfer-full-name }} enables you to migrate data to a {{ MG }}/{{ SD }} (Managed Service for MongoDB) database and implement various data transfer, processing, and transformation scenarios. To implement a transfer:

1. [Explore possible data transfer scenarios](#scenarios).
1. [Configure one of the supported data sources](#supported-sources).
1. [Prepare your {{ MG }}/{{ SD }} (Managed Service for MongoDB) database](#prepare) for the transfer.
1. [Configure the target endpoint](#endpoint-settings) in {{ data-transfer-full-name }}.
1. [Create](../../transfer.md#create) a transfer and [start](../../transfer.md#activate) it.
1. [Perform the required operations with the database](#db-actions) and [see how the transfer is going](../../monitoring.md).
1. In case of any issues, [use ready-made solutions](#troubleshooting) to resolve them.

## Scenarios for transferring data to {{ MG }}/{{ SD }} (Managed Service for MongoDB) {#scenarios}

1. {% include [migration](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/scenario-captions/migration.md) %}
    
    * [Migrating a {{ MG }} cluster](../../../tutorials/storedoc.md)
    * [Migrating a {{ SD }} (Managed Service for MongoDB) cluster from 4.4 to 6.0](../../../tutorials/storedoc-versions.md)

1. {% include [queue](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/scenario-captions/queue.md) %}
    
    * [Delivering data from {{ KF }} to {{ SD }} (Managed Service for MongoDB)](../../../tutorials/mkf-to-mmg.md)

For a detailed description of possible {{ data-transfer-full-name }} scenarios, see [Tutorials](../../../tutorials/index.md).

## Configuring the data source {#supported-sources}

Configure one of the supported data sources:

* [{{ MG }}/{{ SD }}](../source/mongodb.md)
* [{{ AB }}](../../../transfer-matrix.md#airbyte)
* [{{ DS }}](../source/data-streams.md)
* [{{ KF }}](../source/kafka.md)

For a complete list of supported sources and targets in {{ data-transfer-full-name }}, see [Available transfers](../../../transfer-matrix.md).

## Preparing the target database {#prepare}

{% include [prepare db](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/endpoints/targets/mongodb-prepare.md) %}

## Configuring a {{ MG }}/{{ SD }} (Managed Service for MongoDB) target endpoint {#endpoint-settings}

{% include [MongodDB Version](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/notes/mongodb-version.md) %}

When [creating](../index.md#create) or [updating](../index.md#update) an endpoint, you can define:

* [{{ mmg-full-name }} cluster](#managed-service) connection or [custom installation](#on-premise) settings, including those based on {{ compute-full-name }} VMs. These are required parameters.
* [Additional parameters](#additional-settings).


### {{ mmg-name }} (Managed Service for MongoDB) cluster {#managed-service}


{% note warning %}

To create or edit an endpoint of a managed database, you will need the [`{{ roles.mmg.viewer }}`](../../../../storedoc/security/index.md#mmg-viewer) role or the primitive [`viewer`](../../../../iam/roles-reference.md#viewer) role for the folder the cluster of this managed database resides in.

{% endnote %}

Connecting to the database with the cluster ID specified in {{ yandex-cloud }}.

{% note warning %}

By default, {{ data-transfer-name }} transfers collections without sharding. If you are transferring data to a sharded target cluster and want your collections to be sharded:

1. [Prepare the target cluster](../../prepare.md#target-mg) to shard the collections.
1. Select `DISABLED` or `TRUNCATE` for cleanup policy.

Selecting the `DROP` policy will cause the service to delete all the data, including sharded collections, from the target database and replace them with new non-sharded ones when activating a transfer.

{% endnote %}

After configuring the data source and target, [create and start the transfer](../../transfer.md#create).

## Operations with the database during transfer {#db-actions}

## Troubleshooting data transfer issues {#troubleshooting}

Known issues when using a {{ MG }} endpoint:

* [Collection key size exceeds 5 MB](#string-size).
* [Collection object size exceeds 16 MB](#object-size).
* [No tables found](#no-tables).
* [Error when transferring a sharded cluster](#sharded).
* [Error when transferring timeseries collections](#timeseries).
* [Unable to recognize an external cluster IP address or FQDN](#cluster-config-issue).
