Neuroanalyst streamlines the creation and editing of visualizations in Editor. Available for three visualization types: [Table](./widgets/table.md), [Markdown](./widgets/markdown.md), and [Advanced chart](./widgets/advanced.md). Neuroanalyst only works with the **Prepare** tab.

To activate Neuroanalyst, click **Help me code** at the top in Editor to open the **Neuroanalyst** tab on the right.

The AI assistant in Editor will help you create charts from scratch, optimize their structure, and correct errors. Simply give a detailed description of the chart you want to get, and the AI will help you implement it in code.

Use the following options:

* At the bottom of the tab, enable **Consider code**: the helper will analyze your current code in the [Prepare](./tabs.md#prepare) tab and suggest contextual edits.
* At the bottom of the tab, click **Apply** to replace the contents of the **Prepare** tab with AI-generated code. You will immediately see the difference between the current changes and your saved version.

{% note warning %}

Changes introduced via the Neuroanalyst are not yet saved to the local Editor history. Save your draft versions often to avoid losing your progress.
