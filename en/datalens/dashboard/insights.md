Neuroanalyst on your dashboard is a tool that analyzes the selected dashboard chart, generates findings based on its data, and allows you to ask follow-up questions. This data is complemented by the dashboard description and dashboard chart title. For all charts, the chart description and tooltip will also be added, if any.

To enable Neuroanalyst, click ![icon](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) â†’ **Find insights** in the top right corner of the dashboard chart.
