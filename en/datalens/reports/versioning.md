# Versioning


{% include [business-note](../../_includes/datalens/datalens-functionality-available-business-note.md) %}


Report versioning means storing the history of report configuration changes through versions. A list of versions is available to users with the lowest edit permission for the report.

To go to the list of versions, click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) at the top of the screen and select ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/clock.svg) **Change history**.

To select a version from the list, click it. The version number will be displayed in the `revId` parameter in the report address string. Click a link with the version number in the `revId` parameter to open the relevant version of the report.

Unsaved changes in the current version are reset:

* When refreshing the page.
* When saving a report.
* When switching to another version.

## Version types {#version-types}

All versions fall into the following types:

1. **Current**: This is the most recently saved version of a report.

   The version is displayed:
   
   * To all users on dashboards.
   * When navigating to a report.
   * When opening a report in a workbook.
   * When using the dashboard context menu to open a report for editing.
   
   A report can only have one current version.

   A user with **{{ permission-write }}** permissions can make any report version current.
  
   {% note warning %}
  
   When you update any version, except a draft, a new report version is created.

   {% endnote %}
  
1. **Outdated**: This version is no longer current.  
   When you open an outdated version, a panel appears at the top indicating the version type, creation date and time, and login of the version author. There are buttons in the right-hand panel:

   * **Make current**: Turns an outdated version into the current one. The version current at the time will become outdated.
   * **Open current**: Opens the current version.

   {% cut "Outdated version" %}

   {% endcut %}

{% note tip %}

You can share any report version by adding the `revId` parameter to the report link, e.g., `?revId=zac5m4edoaqqr`.

{% endnote %}

## Creating a new version {#version-create}

A new version is automatically created:

* In the current/outdated report version edit mode, after you click **Save** (which creates a new current version).
* In outdated report version view mode, after you click **Make current**.

Below are report configuration changes that create a new version once they are saved:

* Editing [report settings](./report-operations.md#report-settings).
* Editing report [page settings](./report-operations.md#page-settings).
* [Adding](./report-operations.md#add-widget), editing, or [removing](./report-operations.md#delete-widget) widgets.
* [Moving](./report-operations.md#move-widget-front-or-back) a widget to the foreground or background.
* Adding, deleting, or editing selector settings.

## Editing versions {#version-edit}

You can edit any version of a report.

### Editing a current version {#actual-version-edit}

Editing a report opens its current version by default. To save your changes, click **Save** at the top right. This will create a new current version, making the previous one outdated.

### Editing an outdated version {#current-version-edit}

To edit an outdated version, select it from the list of versions. To save your changes to an outdated version, click **Save** at the top right. This will create a new current version, making the previous one outdated.

## Limitations {#restrictions}

* The change history only contains a list of report versions and indicates the version type, save date and time, and user who made the change.
* Report versions do not include changes to access permissions; this operation is performed separately from report edits.
* Versions do not display a list of changes. You can only view the saved status of the report configuration.
