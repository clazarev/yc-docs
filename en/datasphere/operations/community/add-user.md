# Adding a user to a community

{% include [include](../../../_includes/datasphere/organization-users.md) %}

1. {% include [ui-find-community](../../../_includes/datasphere/ui-find-community.md) %}
1. Select the community to add a user to.
1. Go to the **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.common.members }}** tab and click **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.common.add-member }}**.
1. Select one or more users from the list and click **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.common.add }}**.

   If the user you need is not on the list, click **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.common.copy-link }}** and send them the copied link in any convenient way.

   Once the user accepts the invitation or follows the link, they become a member of the community.

   {% note alert %}

   The link does not expire. We recommend recreating the link from time to time to prevent former users from rejoining the community.

   {% endnote %}
