# Linking a billing account

A [billing account](../../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md) is used to identify the user who pays for computing resources, [nodes](../../concepts/deploy/index.md#node), and resource storage for all community projects.

You can [create](../../../billing/operations/create-new-account.md) a {{ yandex-cloud }} billing account in advance and link it when [creating a community](./create.md). You can also create a new billing account in the {{ ml-platform-name }} interface when selecting a billing account for the community.

{% note warning %}

If the selected billing account has an outstanding balance or suspended status, you will not be able to link it to a {{ ml-platform-name }} community. If this is the case, go to [{{ billing-name }}]({{ link-console-billing }}), select your account, and follow the prompts in the interface. Once the billing account is active, try to link it to {{ ml-platform-name }} again. Learn more about billing account statuses [here](../../../billing/concepts/billing-account-statuses.md).

{% endnote %}

Only a community user with the `datasphere.communities.editor` role or higher can link a billing account to a community. To manage billing accounts, you also [need the `billing.accounts.editor` role](../../../billing/security/) or higher. If you are a community admin but have no access to billing accounts in your organization, contact your organization's admin in {{ yandex-cloud }}.

You cannot unlink a community from a billing account, but you can change the account for with a different one, if required.
