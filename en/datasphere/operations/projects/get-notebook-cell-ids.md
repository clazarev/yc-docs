## Getting a notebook ID {#get-notebook-id}

1. In the left-hand panel of your file browser, right-click the notebook you need.
1. In the window that opens, select **Copy Path**.

    The clipboard will contain a string that looks like this:

    ```text
    /home/jupyter/datasphere/project/<notebook_name>.ipynb
    ```

1. Use the copied path as the notebook ID.
