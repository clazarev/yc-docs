# Using a shared resource

In your project, you can use a resource available to the entire community.

To share a resource within a community, you need the `Editor` role in the project and the `Developer` role in the community. To learn more about roles in {{ ml-platform-name }}, see [{#T}](../../security/index.md).

To use a shared resource:

1. {% include [include](../../../_includes/datasphere/ui-find-project.md) %}
1. Select the resource under **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.project-page.project-resources }}**.
1. Go to the **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.common.shared-with-project-resources }}** tab.
1. Click ![options](../../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) next to the resource and select **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.common.add-to-project }}**.
