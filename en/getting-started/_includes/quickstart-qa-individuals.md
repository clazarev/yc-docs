## FAQ {#qa}

### Questions about billing accounts and paid use {#billing-account}

#### Why do I need a billing account with a linked bank card? {#linked-bank-card}

Billing accounts are used to identify users paying for {{ yandex-cloud }} resources. Even if you plan to use only free services, you still need a billing account: this is how you get your grants and promo codes. 

To activate a billing account, we ask you to link a bank card to make sure you are a human, not a robot. As soon as you link a card, a small amount will be debited from it and promptly returned. That is how we verify that your card is real.

### Questions about the initial grant {#grant}

#### I have not used up the initial grant, but my cloud is blocked. What should I do? {#cloud-blocked-during-trial}

Make sure that a valid card is linked to your account. If you linked the card and then deleted it, your account may be blocked.

#### I was unable to use up the initial grant within 60 days. Can I use {{ yandex-cloud }}? {#initial-grant-expiring}

Yes, usage charges will be debited from the card linked to your account. For more information, see [Billing cycle for individuals](../../billing/payment/billing-cycle-individual.md).

### Questions about documents {#documents}

#### Is it safe to pay to {{ yandex-cloud }}? {#payment-security}

The {{ yandex-cloud }} platform meets the PCI DSS requirements, which makes its cloud services safe for payment processing. For more information about PCI DSS certification, see [{#T}](../../security/conform.md#pci-dss).

#### Where do I find my agreement with {{ yandex-cloud }}? {#offer}

{% include [contract-concept](../../_includes/billing/contract.md) %}

There is no printed form of the offer.

Also, we do not provide physical invoices. For more information, see [{#T}](../../billing/operations/download-reporting-docs.md).

#### I need an agreement signed by both parties, not an offer. Can I get it? {#signed-agreement}

Yes, companies and individual entrepreneurs can sign a bilateral contract. To do this, submit a [request to support]({{ link-console-support }}). A {{ yandex-cloud }} manager will contact you to discuss the terms.

#### How do I get invoiced? {#invoice}

To get an invoice for a bank payment, follow the steps described in [{#T}](../../billing/operations/pay-the-bill.md#legal-entities).

{{ yandex-cloud }} does not provide paper payment documents.
