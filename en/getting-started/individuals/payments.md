# Account top-up and spending control

Follow this tutorial to set up payments for your organization's resources.

After you are done creating a billing account, your [personal account balance](../../billing/concepts/personal-account.md#balance) will be zero by default. We recommend that you keep track and [maintain a positive balance](../../billing/operations/pay-the-bill.md) at all times.

{% note warning %}

If you fail to top up your account on time and run into arrears, your use of {{ yandex-cloud }} services may be suspended. For more information, see [Billing cycle](../../billing/payment/billing-cycle-individual.md).

{% endnote %}

{% include [personal-account-balance](../../billing/_includes/personal-account-balance.md) %}

## Top up your personal account {#pay-personal-account}

1. In [{{ billing-name }}]({{ link-console-billing }}) under **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.title_accounts }}**, select a billing account.
1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.dashboard-overview.button_refill }}**.
1. Enter the payment amount and click **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.dashboard-overview.popup-refill_button_individual-action }}**.
1. Enter your card details and click **Pay**.

{% include [payment-card-types](../../_includes/billing/payment-card-types.md) %}

Your payment will be processed in real time and completed within 15 minutes.

## Use budgets for spending control {#use-budgets}

A _budget_ is a way to control how much you spend on resources in {{ yandex-cloud }}.

You use a budget to configure who will get notifications and for which threshold. You can set multiple thresholds and define different notification recipients for each one. You can learn more about budgets [here](../../billing/concepts/budget.md).

{% note info %}

Reaching a pre-set threshold does not affect subsequent resource utilization.

{% endnote %}

To control your spending in {{ yandex-cloud }}, [create a budget](#create-budget) and set up notifications for it.

You can use the following budgets in {{ billing-name }}:

* _{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.budgets.label_type-cost }}_: Notification is sent when the cost of resources, without discounts applied, exceeds a specified usage limit.
* _{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.budgets.label_type-expense }}_: Notification is sent when the cost of resources, with discounts and active promo codes applied, exceeds a specified usage limit.
* _{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.budgets.label_type-balance }}_: Notification is sent when the personal account balance falls below a specified threshold.

### Create a budget {#create-budget}

1. In [{{ billing-name }}]({{ link-console-billing }}) under **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.title_accounts }}**, select a billing account.
1. Go to the **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.budgets.label_budgets }}** page and click **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.budgets.button_create }}**.

   1. Enter the budget name.
   1. Select **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.budgets.label_type }}**.
   1. Set **Budget amount**:

      * For the **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.budgets.label_type-cost }}** or **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.budgets.label_type-expense }}** type, specify the total usage cost.
      * For the **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.budgets.label_type-balance }}** type, specify the account balance.

   1. For the **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.budgets.label_type-cost }}** and **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.budgets.label_type-expense }}** types:
      * Select your budget calculation period: **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.budgets.reset-period_value_monthly }}**, **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.budgets.reset-period_value_quarter }}**, **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.budgets.reset-period_value_annually }}**, or **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.budgets.reset-period_value_custom }}**.
      * If you select **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.budgets.reset-period_value_custom }}**, set the budget start date. The start date is the first day of the month.
      * Set the budget end date. The end date defines when the budget stops tracking usage or the account balance and sending notifications. The end date is the last day of the month. It must be within five years of the current date.
   1. For the **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.budgets.label_type-balance }}** type, set the budget end date. The end date defines when the budget stops tracking usage or the account balance and sending notifications. The end date is the last day of the month. It must be within five years of the current date.
   1. Select the users to notify.
   1. For the **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.budgets.label_type-cost }}** and **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.budgets.label_type-expense }}** types, define the budget scope. You can select individual clouds, folders, and services to include in a set budget. By default, data is collected from all the clouds, folders, and services that the selected billing account has access to.
   1. Set at least one utilization threshold to trigger notifications. You can specify a threshold as a percentage or a cash value and select the users to receive notifications. A budget can have multiple thresholds.

   {% note info %}

   Users listed in the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.section-base }}** section will receive notifications when each specified threshold is exceeded. Users listed when setting a threshold will only receive a notification when that specific threshold is reached.

   If several budget thresholds are reached at the same time, users will receive a single notification.

   {% endnote %}

1. After filling in all the fields, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.create }}**. This will create a budget.

{% note tip %}

You can create a trigger that will invoke a [function](../../functions/concepts/function.md) in {{ sf-name }} or run a [container](../../serverless-containers/concepts/container.md) in {{ serverless-containers-name }} when threshold values are exceeded. Read more about [triggers for budgets](../../functions/operations/trigger/budget-trigger-create.md).

{% endnote %}

## Monitor your payment history {#control-pay}

You can view the full history of payments to your [personal account](../../billing/concepts/personal-account.md#balance) on the **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.switch_history }}** page or in [Yandex Balance](https://yandex.ru/support/balance/operations/find-bill.html). The tracking method depends on your legal status ([billing account type](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md#ba-types)).
Payment receipt information is generated by Yandex Balance (to learn more, see the [Yandex Balance documentation](https://yandex.ru/support/balance/concepts/receipts.html)).

Individuals can view the full history of payments on theÂ **{{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.switch_history }}** page.
<br/>All payments are arranged chronologically, with the earliest payment displayed at the very bottom.
<br/>To filter the payments, set the date range. The results will be displayed in a table with the following columns:

  Name  | Description
  ----- | -----
  {{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.history.column_description }} | Payment details.
  {{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.history.column_date }} | Date when funds were credited to the personal account.
  {{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.history.column_status }} | Payment status.
  {{ ui-key.yacloud_billing.billing.account.history.column_money }} | Amount actually credited to the personal account, in rubles.

<br/>The payment history contains aggregate data on all services. For detailed information on the provided services, see [Usage details](../../billing/operations/check-charges.md).
