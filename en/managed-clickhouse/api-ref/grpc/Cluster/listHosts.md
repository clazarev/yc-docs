# Managed Service for ClickHouse API, gRPC: ClusterService.ListHosts

Retrieves a list of hosts for the specified cluster.

## gRPC request

**rpc ListHosts ([ListClusterHostsRequest](#yandex.cloud.mdb.clickhouse.v1.ListClusterHostsRequest)) returns ([ListClusterHostsResponse](#yandex.cloud.mdb.clickhouse.v1.ListClusterHostsResponse))**

## ListClusterHostsRequest {#yandex.cloud.mdb.clickhouse.v1.ListClusterHostsRequest}

```json
{
  "cluster_id": "string",
  "page_size": "int64",
  "page_token": "string"
}
```

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| cluster_id | **string**

Required field. ID of the ClickHouse cluster.
To get the ClickHouse cluster ID use a [ClusterService.List](/docs/managed-clickhouse/api-ref/grpc/Cluster/list#List) request. ||
|| page_size | **int64**

The maximum number of results per page to return. If the number of available
results is larger than `page_size`, the service returns a [ListClusterHostsResponse.next_page_token](#yandex.cloud.mdb.clickhouse.v1.ListClusterHostsResponse)
that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. ||
|| page_token | **string**

Page token.  To get the next page of results, set `page_token` to the [ListClusterHostsResponse.next_page_token](#yandex.cloud.mdb.clickhouse.v1.ListClusterHostsResponse)
returned by the previous list request. ||

## ListClusterHostsResponse {#yandex.cloud.mdb.clickhouse.v1.ListClusterHostsResponse}

```json
{
  "hosts": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "cluster_id": "string",
      "zone_id": "string",
      "type": "Type",

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| hosts[] | **[Host](#yandex.cloud.mdb.clickhouse.v1.Host)**

Requested list of hosts for the cluster. ||
|| next_page_token | **string**

This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results
is larger than [ListClusterHostsRequest.page_size](#yandex.cloud.mdb.clickhouse.v1.ListClusterHostsRequest), use the `next_page_token` as the value
for the [ListClusterHostsRequest.page_token](#yandex.cloud.mdb.clickhouse.v1.ListClusterHostsRequest) query parameter in the next list request.
Each subsequent list request will have its own `next_page_token` to continue paging through the results. ||
