# {{ mch-name }} storage


{{ mch-name }} allows you to use network and local storage drives for database clusters. Network drives are based on network blocks, which are virtual disks in the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure. Local disks are physically located on the database host servers.

{% include [storage-type](../../_includes/mdb/mch/storage-type.md) %}

## Hybrid storage features {#hybrid-storage-features}

If you enable the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.forms.additional-field-cloud-storage }}** setting when creating or updating a cluster, you will be able to distribute data between cluster storage and [{{ objstorage-full-name }}](../../storage/) object storage. Thus your data will reside in either cluster or object storage, depending on the storage policy you specify. For example, you can choose to store your frequently used (_hot_) data in cluster storage and the rarely used (_cold_) data in the less expensive and slower object storage.

{% note warning %}

Hybrid storage is only available for [MergeTree]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree/) tables. For tables powered by other engines, only cluster storage can be used.

{% endnote %}

Object storage uses a service bucket with unlimited storage capacity. It has the Standard [storage class](../../storage/concepts/storage-class.md), which cannot be changed. [{{ objstorage-name }} service limits](../../storage/concepts/limits.md) apply to object storage.

To start using hybrid storage:

1. Create a cluster of the appropriate type. You do not need to configure object storage.

1. Add databases and tables to the cluster. If the default storage policy is not suitable for some tables, set the appropriate policies for these tables:

    * To set a policy when creating a table, configure the `storage_policy` setting:

        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE table_with_non_default_policy (
            <table_schema>
        ) ENGINE = MergeTree
        ...
        SETTINGS storage_policy = '<storage_policy_type>';
        ```

    * To create or update the policy for an existing table, run the following query:

        ```sql
        ALTER TABLE table_with_non_default_policy
        MODIFY SETTING storage_policy = '<storage_policy_type>';
        ```

See an example in the [Using hybrid storage](../tutorials/hybrid-storage.md) tutorial.

To monitor the amount of space used by [MergeTree]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree/) table chunks in {{ objstorage-full-name }}, use the `ch_s3_disk_parts_size` [metric](../tutorials/hybrid-storage.md#metrics) in {{ monitoring-full-name }}. It is only available for {{ mch-name }} clusters with hybrid storage.

Storing cold data and its backups in hybrid storage counts towards the total [cluster usage cost](../pricing.md#prices-storage).

### Available storage policies {#storage-policies}

{% note info %}

You cannot create new storage policies or update the existing ones.

{% endnote %}

A {{ mch-name }} cluster with enabled hybrid storage supports the following storage policies:

* `default`: Cluster automatically manages data placement depending on the following:

    * [Hybrid storage settings](#hybrid-storage-settings).
    * Table [TTL]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree/#mergetree-table-ttl) (time-to-live) settings.

    If there is enough free space in the cluster storage, only the rows with the expired TTL are moved to object storage. This operation allows you to move part of the data to object storage before the cluster storage becomes full.

    You can configure moving the expired rows to object storage and set the TTL value when creating a table or later.

* `local`: For a table with this policy, rows can only reside in a cluster storage. There is no data transfer between storages.

* `object_storage`: For a table with this policy, rows can only reside in an object storage. There is no data transfer between storages.

Storage policies do not affect [merge operations]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/custom-partitioning-key/) for data parts. With any storage policy, you can:

* Enable and disable the `prefer_not_to_merge` setting that merges stored data parts. This setting is available in the [CLI and API](../operations/update.md#change-hybrid-storage).
* Set any `max_data_part_size_bytes` value for the maximum size of the data part you can get upon merging smaller ones.

However, you can configure the behavior of these operations using the [settings](./settings-list.md) available in the cluster.

You can view up-to-date policy settings with the following query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM system.storage_policies;
```

For more information about storage policies and their settings, see the [{{ CH }} documentation]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree/#table_engine-mergetree-multiple-volumes).

### Hybrid storage settings {#hybrid-storage-settings}


A {{ mch-name }} cluster with enabled hybrid storage has the following settings:

* `data_cache_enabled`: Enables temporary storage in cluster storage of data requested from object storage. Default value: `true` (enabled).

    In this case, <q>cold</q> data requested from object storage is written to fast drives where data processing takes less time.

* `data_cache_max_size`: Sets the maximum cache size (in bytes) allocated in cluster storage for temporarily storage of data requested from object storage. Default value: `1073741824` (1 GB).
* `move_factor`: Sets the minimum share of free space in cluster storage. If the minimum share is below this value, the data will be moved to {{ objstorage-full-name }}. Minimum value: `0`; maximum value: `1`; default: `0.01`.

    Data parts are queued up in descending order by size, and then as many of them are moved as will satisfy the `move_factor` condition.

* `prefer_not_to_merge`: Disables [merging of data parts]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/custom-partitioning-key/) in cluster and object storages. The merge functionality is enabled by default.

    Once inserted into the table, the data is saved as a data part and sorted based on the primary key. Next the data parts belonging to the same partition are merged in the background into a larger data part within 10 to 15 minutes after the insertion. You can use the [system.parts]({{ ch.docs }}/operations/system-tables/parts#system_tables-parts) system table to view the merged data parts and partitions.

You can specify hybrid storage settings when [creating](../operations/cluster-create.md) or [updating](../operations/update.md#change-hybrid-storage) a cluster.

For more information about setting up hybrid storage, see the [{{ CH }} documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/ru/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree/#table_engine-mergetree-multiple-volumes).

## Selecting disk type during cluster creation {#storage-type-selection}

The number of hosts you can create together with a {{ CH }} cluster depends on the selected disk type:

* With local SSD storage (`local-ssd`), you can create a cluster with two or more hosts.

    This cluster will be fault-tolerant.

    Local SSD storage has an effect on how much a cluster will cost: you pay for it even if it is stopped. For more information, refer to the [pricing policy](../pricing.md).

* With non-replicated network SSD storage (`network-ssd-nonreplicated`), you can create a cluster with three or more hosts.

    This cluster will be fault-tolerant.

* You can add any number of hosts within the current quota when using the following disk types:

    * Network HDDs (`network-hdd`)
    * Network SSDs (`network-ssd`)
    * Ultra high-speed network SSDs with three replicas (`network-ssd-io-m3`)

For more information about limits on the number of hosts per cluster, see [Quotas and limits](./limits.md).
