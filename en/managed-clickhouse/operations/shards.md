# Managing shards in a {{ CH }} cluster

You can enable sharding for a cluster, as well as add and configure individual shards.

## Enabling sharding {#enable}

{{ mch-name }} clusters are created with a single shard. To start sharding data, [add](#add-shard) one or more shards and [create](../tutorials/sharding.md#example) a distributed table.

## Creating a shard {#add-shard}

The number of shards in {{ mch-name }} clusters is limited by the CPU and RAM quotas available to DB clusters in your cloud. To check the resources currently in use, open the [Quotas]({{ link-console-quotas }}) page and find **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_managed-clickhouse }}**.

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), navigate to the folder dashboard and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_managed-clickhouse }}**.
  1. Click the cluster name and go to the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.clickhouse.cluster.switch_shards }}** tab.
  1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.cluster.shards.action_add-shard }}**.
  1. Specify the following shard properties:
     * Name and weight.
     * To copy the schema from a random replica of one of the shards to the hosts of the new shard, select the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.forms.field_copy_schema }}** option.
     * Required number of hosts.
  1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.forms.button_create-shard }}**.

- CLI {#cli}

  {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  To create a shard, run the command below (our example does not use all available parameters):

  ```bash
  {{ yc-mdb-ch }} shards add <new_shard_name> \
    --cluster-name=<cluster_name> \
    --host zone-id=<availability_zone>,`
      `subnet-name=<subnet_name>
  ```

  Where:

  
  * `<new_shard_name>`: New shard name that must be unique within the cluster.

    It may contain Latin letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores. The name can be up to 63 characters long.
  * `--cluster-name`: Cluster name.

    You can get the cluster name with the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
  * `--host`: Host settings:
    * `zone-id`: [Availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md).
    * `subnet-name`: [Subnet](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet) name.


- {{ TF }} {#tf}

  {% note info %}

  {{ TF }} does not support specifying shard weight.

  {% endnote %}

  1. Open the current {{ TF }} configuration file that defines your infrastructure.

     For more information about creating this file, see [this guide](cluster-create.md).
  1. Add the `CLICKHOUSE`-type `host` section with the `shard_name` field filled to the {{ mch-name }} cluster description or update existing hosts:

     ```hcl
     resource "yandex_mdb_clickhouse_cluster" "<cluster_name>" {
       ...
       host {
         type       = "CLICKHOUSE"
         zone       = "<availability_zone>"
         subnet_id  = yandex_vpc_subnet.<subnet_in_availability_zone>.id
         shard_name = "<shard_name>"
       }
     }
     ```

  1. Make sure the settings are correct.

     {% include [terraform-validate](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/validate.md) %}

  1. Confirm updating the resources.

     {% include [terraform-apply](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}

- REST API {#api}

  1. [Get an IAM token for API authentication](../api-ref/authentication.md) and save it as an environment variable:

     {% include [api-auth-token](../../_includes/mdb/api-auth-token.md) %}

  1. Use the [Cluster.AddShard](../api-ref/Cluster/addShard.md) method and send the following request, e.g., via {{ api-examples.rest.tool }}:

     1. Create a file named `body.json` and paste the following code into it:

        ```json
        {
          "shardName": "<shard_name>",
          "configSpec": {
            "clickhouse": {
              "resources": {
                "resourcePresetId": "<host_class>",
                "diskSize": "<storage_size_in_bytes>",
                "diskTypeId": "<disk_type>"
              },

              "subnetId": "<subnet_ID>",
              "assignPublicIp": <public_access_to_host>,
              "shardName": "<shard_name>"
            }
          ],
          "copySchema": <data_schema_copying>
        }
        ```

        Where:

        * `shardName`: Shard name.
        * `configSpec.clickhouse.resources`: Host resources to add to the new shard:

          * `resourcePresetId`: [Host class](../concepts/instance-types.md) ID. You can get the list of available host classes with their IDs using the [ResourcePreset.List](../api-ref/ResourcePreset/list.md) method.
          * `diskSize`: Disk size, in bytes.
          * `diskTypeId`: [Disk type](../concepts/storage.md).

        * `configSpec.clickhouse.weight`: Shard weight.

          By default, each shard is assigned a weight of `1`. If you assign a higher weight to a shard, the data will be distributed among the shards according to their weights.

          To calculate the shard priority for data distribution, the system adds up the weights of all shards and then divides each shard's weight by the total. For example, if one shard has a weight of `1` and another has a weight of `3`, then the first shard's priority is `1/4` and the second shard's priority is `3/4`. The higher the priority, the more data the shard will get.

          For more information, see [this {{ CH }} article]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/special/distributed).

        * `hostSpecs`: Settings of hosts to add to the shard. The settings appear as an array of elements, one for each host. Each element has the following structure:

          * `zoneId`: Availability zone.
          * `type`: Host type. You can only add `CLICKHOUSE` hosts to your shards.
          * `subnetId`: Subnet ID.

          * `shardName`: Shard name.

        * `copySchema`: Copying the data schema from a random replica of one of the shards to the hosts of the new shard. The possible values are: `true` or `false`.

     1. Run this query:

        ```bash
        curl \
          --request POST \
          --header "Authorization: Bearer $IAM_TOKEN" \
          --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
          --url 'https://{{ api-host-mdb }}/managed-clickhouse/v1/clusters/<cluster_ID>/shards' \
          --data '@body.json'
        ```

        You can get the cluster ID with the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

       yandex.cloud.mdb.clickhouse.v1.ClusterService.UpdateShard
     ```

     Where:

     * `update_mask`: List of parameters to update as an array of `paths[]` strings.
     * `config_spec.clickhouse`: Shard parameters to update:

       * `config`: [{{ CH }} settings](../concepts/settings-list.md). For a list of available settings, see the [method description](../api-ref/Cluster/updateShard.md#yandex.cloud.mdb.clickhouse.v1.UpdateClusterShardRequest).

       * `resources`: Host resources to add to the new shard:

         * `resource_preset_id`: [Host class](../concepts/instance-types.md) ID. You can get the list of available host classes with their IDs using the [ResourcePreset.List](../api-ref/ResourcePreset/list.md) method.
         * `disk_size`: Disk size, in bytes.
         * `disk_type_id`: [Disk type](../concepts/storage.md).

       * `weight`: Shard weight.

         By default, each shard is assigned a weight of `1`. If you assign a higher weight to a shard, the data will be distributed among the shards according to their weights.

         To calculate the shard priority for data distribution, the system adds up the weights of all shards and then divides each shard's weight by the total. For example, if one shard has a weight of `1` and another has a weight of `3`, then the first shard's priority is `1/4` and the second shard's priority is `3/4`. The higher the priority, the more data the shard will get.

         For more information, see [this {{ CH }} article]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/special/distributed).

     You can get the cluster ID with the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters), and the shard name, with the [list of shards in the cluster](#list-shards).

## Deleting a shard {#delete-shard}

You can delete a shard from a {{ CH }} cluster in case:
* It is not the only shard.
* It is not the only shard in a [shard group](shard-groups.md).

Deleting a shard will delete all tables and data stored on that shard.

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), navigate to the folder dashboard and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_managed-clickhouse }}**.
  1. Click the name of your cluster and open the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.clickhouse.cluster.switch_shards }}** tab.
  1. Click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) next to the host in question and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.clusters.button_action-delete }}**.

- CLI {#cli}

  {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  To delete a shard from a cluster, run this command:

  ```bash
  {{ yc-mdb-ch }} shards delete <shard_name> \
    --cluster-name=<cluster_name>
  ```

  You can get the shard name with the [list of shards in the cluster](#list-shards), and the cluster name, with the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

  1. Open the current {{ TF }} configuration file that defines your infrastructure.

     For more information about creating this file, see [this guide](cluster-create.md).
  1. Remove the `host` section with the shard description from the {{ mch-name }} cluster description.
  1. Validate your configuration.

     {% include [terraform-validate](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/validate.md) %}

  1. Type `yes` and press **Enter**.

- REST API {#api}

  1. [Get an IAM token for API authentication](../api-ref/authentication.md) and save it as an environment variable:

     {% include [api-auth-token](../../_includes/mdb/api-auth-token.md) %}

  1. Use the [Cluster.DeleteShard](../api-ref/Cluster/deleteShard.md) method and send the following request, e.g., via {{ api-examples.rest.tool }}:

     ```bash
     curl \
       --request DELETE \
       --header "Authorization: Bearer $IAM_TOKEN" \
       --url 'https://{{ api-host-mdb }}/managed-clickhouse/v1/clusters/<cluster_ID>/shards/<shard_name>'
     ```

     You can request the cluster ID with the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters) and the shard name, with the [list of shards in the cluster](#list-shards).

  1. View the [server response](../api-ref/Cluster/deleteShard.md#yandex.cloud.operation.Operation) to make sure your request was successful.

- gRPC API {#grpc-api}

  1. [Get an IAM token for API authentication](../api-ref/authentication.md) and save it as an environment variable:

     {% include [api-auth-token](../../_includes/mdb/api-auth-token.md) %}

  1. {% include [grpc-api-setup-repo](../../_includes/mdb/grpc-api-setup-repo.md) %}
  1. Use the [ClusterService.DeleteShard](../api-ref/grpc/Cluster/deleteShard.md) call and send the following request, e.g., via {{ api-examples.grpc.tool }}:

     ```bash
     grpcurl \
       -format json \
       -import-path ~/cloudapi/ \
       -import-path ~/cloudapi/third_party/googleapis/ \
       -proto ~/cloudapi/yandex/cloud/mdb/clickhouse/v1/cluster_service.proto \
       -rpc-header "Authorization: Bearer $IAM_TOKEN" \
       -d '{
             "cluster_id": "<cluster_ID>",
             "shard_name": "<shard_name>"
           }' \
       {{ api-host-mdb }}:{{ port-https }} \
       yandex.cloud.mdb.clickhouse.v1.ClusterService.DeleteShard
     ```

     You can get the cluster ID with the [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters), and the shard name, with the [list of shards in the cluster](#list-shards).
