# Resource relationships


The main entity used in {{ mgp-name }} is a _database cluster_.

Each cluster consists of database hosts, which are virtual machines with DBMS servers deployed on them. A {{ mgp-name }} cluster contains:

* Two _master hosts_.
* Two or more _segment hosts_.

The _primary_ master host (`PRIMARY`) accepts client connections and SQL queries and distributes them to the segment hosts for processing.

The _standby_ master host (`STANDBY`) continuously replicates the primary one's data but accepts no user connections.

If the primary master fails, the standby one takes over. This way, a cluster with two master hosts continues handling queries if a single master fails.

Segment hosts have standalone DBMS's (_segments_) deployed on them. They store data fragments and perform most operations for handling queries. Each cluster segment has a replica, i.e., a mirror segment that is located on another host and stores a copy of the data from the main segment.

The number of segments is the same for each host. When [expanding a cluster](../operations/cluster-expand.md), you can increase the number of segments. They will be added to all hosts â€” both new and existing ones. You cannot add segments to existing hosts without expanding the cluster.



{{ mgp-name }} cluster hosts are cloud VMs. Such VMs can reside on:

* _Regular {{ yandex-cloud }} hosts_:

    These are physical servers for hosting cluster VMs. They are randomly selected from a pool of available hosts that meet the selected cluster configuration.

* _Dedicated {{ yandex-cloud }} hosts_:

    These are physical servers reserved exclusively for your VMs. VMs on dedicated hosts have all the features of regular VMs. In addition, they are physically isolated from other users' VMs and have access to the whole volume of the physical server's local disks.

    Dedicated hosts are selected from _dedicated host groups_ specified when creating a cluster. You must first [create](../../compute/operations/dedicated-host/create-host-group.md) a group of dedicated hosts in {{ compute-full-name }}.

    To learn more, see [{#T}](../../compute/concepts/dedicated-host.md).


All {{ mgp-name }} cluster hosts are placed in the same availability zone, `{{ region-id }}-a`, `{{ region-id }}-b`, or `{{ region-id }}-d`.

When creating a cluster, specify:

* _Host class_: Template for deploying cluster hosts. For a list of available host classes and their characteristics, see [Host classes](instance-types.md).

* _Environment_: Environment where the cluster will be deployed:
    * `PRODUCTION`: For stable versions of your applications.
    * `PRESTABLE`: For testing purposes. The prestable environment is similar to the production environment and likewise covered by an SLA, but it is the first to get new features, improvements, and bug fixes. In the prestable environment, you can test new versions for compatibility with your application.
