# {{ mgp-full-name }} release notes

## July 2025 {#jul-2025}

Added the ability to [transfer cluster logs to {{ cloud-logging-full-name }}](operations/mgp-to-cloud-logging.md).


## May 2025 {#may-2025}

Added integration with [{{ websql-full-name }}](operations/web-sql-query.md).


## April 2025 {#apr-2025}

You can now [manage resource groups](operations/resource-groups.md) using the {{ yandex-cloud }} CLI.

## October 2024 {#oct-2024}

* The default [Log statement](concepts/settings-list.md#setting-log-statement) value is changed from `ALL` to `DDL`: {{ GP }} logs only SQL commands used to change data structure definitions (such as `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, etc.).
* A new RAM limit is introduced for each {{ GP }} process. The limit is calculated using the following formula: `<segment host's RAM> ÷ (<Max connections> × <number of segments per host>)`.

## September 2024 {#sep-2024}

* {{ mgp-name }} is now available in the Kazakhstan [region](../overview/concepts/region.md).

* Added the new **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.monitoring }}** and **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.cluster.switch_network }}** sections with plots for the respective metrics to the ![monitoring.svg](../_assets/console-icons/display-pulse.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.greenplum.cluster.pxf.value_pxf }}** tab in the management console. For more information, see [Monitoring cluster and host state](operations/monitoring.md).


* Added the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.forms.additional-field-yandex-query_ru }}** option to cluster settings. It enables you to run YQL queries from [{{ yq-full-name }}](../query/concepts/index.md) to a {{ mgp-name }} database.


## June 2024 {#jun-2024}

Now you can [create](operations/index.md#pxf) external S3, JDBC, HDFS, and Hive data sources for accessing external tables.

## February 2024 {#feb-2024}

Added the ability to partially [restore a cluster](./operations/cluster-backups.md#restore) from a backup: now you can specify a list of databases or tables to restore. This greatly reduces the recovery time and saves cluster resources if restoring small amounts of data.

## January 2024 {#jan-2024}

* A new version is out: {{ GP }} 6.25. It features [cold storage integration](tutorials/yezzey.md) tools and a [command center](./concepts/command-center.md) by default.
* Now you can [configure PXF](operations/pxf/settings.md) for accessing external tables yourself. Previously, users had to contact support for PXF configuration.

## Q3 2023 {#q3-2023}

* Added support for [incremental backups](concepts/backup.md).
* Added the option of [committing](../billing/concepts/cvos.md) a specific volume of services. All users of the platform can get a discount up to 22% starting from August 1, 2023. The cost of services will not change during the whole period of the offer.
* Added [PXF metrics](metrics.md#managed-greenplum-pxf-metrics) to {{ monitoring-full-name }}.
* Added logs for PXF and the Odyssey connection pooler.
* Added [audit logs](at-ref.md) in {{ at-full-name }}.

## Q2 2023 {#q2-2023}

* You can now recover from a backup as of any point in time (Point-in-Time-Recovery, PITR). The feature is enabled by default for new clusters.
* When recovering a cluster, you can now select the number of hosts and segments.
* PXF is updated to version 6.6.0.
* Logs now support PXF-based events.

## Q4 2022 {#q4-2022}

* You can now [expand a cluster](operations/cluster-expand.md) via the CLI and API by adding new segment hosts with data redistribution across all segments.
* You can now view cluster backups, recover from backups, and modify public access to the cluster via the CLI. For more information, see [YC CLI releases](../cli/release-notes.md#version0.100.0).
* Added the `mdb_toolkit.table_privileges()` function that allows users with the `mdb_admin` role to view the history of granting and revoking privileges in the cluster. For more information, see [this {{ PG }} article]({{ pg.docs.org }}/current/infoschema-table-privileges.html).
* Added the `mdb_toolkit.gp_workfile_usage_per_query()` function that allows users with the `mdb_admin` role to view information about active queries from all users. For more information, see [this {{ GP }} article]({{ gp.docs.broadcom }}/7/greenplum-database/ref_guide-gp_toolkit.html#topic34).
* Improved the algorithm for creating clusters via the wizard:
    * Cluster size cannot exceed `<maximum_number_of_hosts> × <maximum_disk_size_per_host>`.
    * You can select groups of dedicated hosts to deploy the cluster.
    * If the amount of data you specify is large, the wizard will prompt you to create a cluster on dedicated hosts.

## Q3 2022 {#q3-2022}

* You can now change the administrator password.
* You can now [configure the DBMS and the connection pooler in {{ TF }}](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/terraform-provider-yandex/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0770-july-27-2022).
* Added support for the [postgis]({{ gp.docs.broadcom }}/5/greenplum-database/ref_guide-extensions-postGIS.html) extension.
* Added the ability to edit clusters and cluster settings via CLI as well as to grant access from {{ data-transfer-full-name }}. For more information, see [YC CLI releases](../cli/release-notes.md#version0.94.0).
* Updated the master failover mechanism: a former master is returned to a cluster as a replica and becomes available for another failover right after the first one completes.
* Added the `gp_cancel_backend` function to forcibly stop user queries.
* Added the `gp_terminate_backend` function to forcibly terminate user DB connections.
* Added the ability to expand a cluster with new segment hosts via the API and re-distribute data across all segments.

## Q2 2022 {#q2-2022}

* Added CLI support: `{{ yc-mdb-gp }} cluster` and `{{ yc-mdb-gp }} hosts` commands are available.
* You can now migrate databases from/to {{ mgp-name }} using {{ data-transfer-full-name }}. See the [documentation](../data-transfer/concepts/index.md#connectivity-matrix) for available targets and sources. This feature is at the [Preview](../overview/concepts/launch-stages.md) stage.
* Added support for the [pgcrypto]({{ gp.docs.broadcom }}/7/greenplum-database/ref_guide-modules-pgcrypto.html) extension.
* [Optimized](https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/pull/1257) backup creation through special processing of append-only segments.
* Added the [diskquota]({{ gp.docs.broadcom }}/7/greenplum-database/ref_guide-modules-diskquota.html) module that enables you to limit the amount of disk space used by schemas in a database.
* Implemented automatic switchover to a standby master host using the [gpactivatestandby]({{ gp.docs.broadcom }}/7/greenplum-database/utility_guide-ref-gpactivatestandby.html) utility.
* Added the `max_statement_mem` and `log_statement` settings that are available when creating and changing a cluster.
* Added the ability to create a cluster with an odd number of segments.
* Limited the minimum storage size on network SSD disks for a master host to 100 GB.
* Optimized cleaning process (`VACUUM`):
  * The operation is carried out concurrently across several databases.
  * New tables are processed last.
  * Tables with active locks are excluded.

## Q1 2022 {#q1-2022}

* {{ mgp-full-name }} is now publicly available. It is now subject to a [Service Level Agreement]({{ link-sla-greenplum }}) (SLA) and [pricing rules](pricing/index.md).
* A new version is out with known bugs fixed: {{ GP }} 6.19.
* You can now hide the contents of external tables.
* You can now change the storage size, including for local SSDs.
* Added the `io-optimized` [configurations](concepts/instance-types.md) with an increased GB RAM to vCPU ratio (8:1).
