description: Access management in Apache Kafka, a database creation and management service. This section describes the resources for which you can assign a role, the roles existing in the service, and the roles required for specific actions.

# Access management in {{ mkf-name }}


In this section, you will learn:

* [What resources you can assign a role for](#resources).
* [What roles this service has](#roles-list).
* [What roles are required](#required-roles) for specific actions.

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

To assign a role for a resource, a user should have the `mdb.admin` role, `managed-kafka.admin` role, or one of the following roles for that resource:

{% include [roles-list](../../_includes/iam/roles-list.md) %}

## Resources you can assign a role for {#resources}

{% include [basic-resources](../../_includes/iam/basic-resources-for-access-control.md) %}

To allow access to {{ mkf-name }} resources (clusters, hosts, cluster backups, partitions, topics, and users), assign the user the appropriate roles for the folder, cloud, or organization containing these resources.

## What roles this service has {#roles-list}

The chart below shows the roles existing in the service and their permission inheritance. For example, `{{ roles-editor }}` inherits all the `{{ roles-viewer }}` permissions. You can find the role descriptions below the chart.

{% include [primitive-roles-footnote](../../_includes/primitive-roles-footnote.md) %}

## What roles are required {#required-roles}

To use {{ maf-name }}, you need the [{{ roles.mkf.editor }} role or higher](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) for the folder to house the new cluster. The `{{ roles.mkf.viewer }}` role only allows you to view the list of clusters.

To create a {{ mkf-name }} cluster, you need the [{{ roles-vpc-user }}](../../vpc/security/index.md#vpc-user) role and the `{{ roles.mkf.editor }}` role or higher.

You can always assign a role with more permissions. For example, you can assign the `{{ roles.mkf.admin }}` role instead of `{{ roles.mkf.editor }}`.
