# Access management in {{ mmy-name }}


In this section, you will learn about:

* [What resources support role assignment](#resources).
* [What roles this service has](#roles-list).
* [What roles are required](#required-roles) for specific actions.

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

Roles for a resource can be assigned by users with the `mdb.admin`, `managed-mysql.admin`, or one of the following roles for that resource:

{% include [roles-list](../../_includes/iam/roles-list.md) %}

## Resources supporting role assignment {#resources}

{% include [basic-resources](../../_includes/iam/basic-resources-for-access-control.md) %}

{% include [assign-roles-mdb](../../_includes/iam/assign-roles-mdb.md) %}

## Roles this service has {#roles-list}

The chart below shows serviceâ€™s roles and their permission inheritance. For example, `{{ roles-editor }}` inherits all `{{ roles-viewer }}` permissions. You can find role descriptions under the chart.

## Roles required {#required-roles}

To use the service, you need the [{{ roles.mmy.editor }} role](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) or higher for the folder to house the new cluster. With the `{{ roles.mmy.viewer }}` role, one can only view the list of clusters.

To create a {{ mmy-name }} cluster, you need the [{{ roles-vpc-user }}](../../vpc/security/index.md#vpc-user) role and the `{{ roles.mmy.editor }}` role or higher.

You can always assign a role with more permissions. For example, you can assign the `{{ roles.mmy.admin }}` role instead of `{{ roles.mmy.editor }}`.
