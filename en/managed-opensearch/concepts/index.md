# Resource relationships in {{ mos-name }}

[{{ OS }}](https://opensearch.org/) is a specialized distributed system for storing, searching, visualizing, and analyzing data. When you add a document to {{ OS }}, it is placed into an [_index_](indexing.md). Data from an indexed document is available for [search and analysis](searching.md).

{{ OS }} features [_{{ OS }} Dashboards_](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/), a data visualization UI.

The main entity used in {{ mos-name }} is a database cluster.

Each cluster consists of one or more [_hosts_](host-roles.md), which are virtual machines with DBMS servers deployed. Cluster hosts may reside in different [availability zones](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md). The minimum number of hosts in a cluster depends on the selected [disk type](storage.md#storage-type-selection).

When [creating a cluster](../operations/cluster-create.md), specify:

- [_Host classes_](instance-types.md): VM templates for deploying the cluster hosts.

- _Host groups_: Groups of multiple linked hosts with specific configuration and [roles](host-roles.md):

    - _DATA_: Enable index storage and request processing.
    - _MANAGER_: Ensure fault tolerance of all {{ OS }} components.
    - _DASHBOARDS_: Provide access to {{ OS }} Dashboards.

    A single-host cluster is not fault tolerant. A cluster with multiple hosts automatically ensures fault tolerance for the `MANAGER` role. To ensure data safety in such a cluster, you need to configure index [sharding and replication](scalability-and-resilience.md).

- _Environment_ where the cluster will be deployed:

    - `PRODUCTION`: For stable versions of your applications.
    - `PRESTABLE`: For testing purposes. The prestable environment is similar to the production environment and likewise covered by an SLA, but it is the first to get new features, improvements, and bug fixes. In the prestable environment, you can test new versions for compatibility with your application.


An {{ OS }} cluster created in a folder can be accessed by all VMs connected to the same [cloud network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md) as the cluster.

## Cluster fault tolerance {#high-availability}

For secure cluster data storage and continuous availability, the cluster must meet the following requirements:
* The cluster must not have any indexes with zero replicas or settings that prevent replicas from being created.
* Cluster hosts with the `DATA` role must reside in at least **two** different [availability zones](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md).
* Cluster hosts with the `MANAGER` role must reside in at least **three** different availability zones; and each availability zone must have less than **50%** of such hosts of the total number of hosts with the `MANAGER` role.
