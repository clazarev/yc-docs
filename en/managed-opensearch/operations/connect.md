# Connecting to an {{ OS }} cluster

You can connect to {{ mos-name }} cluster hosts with the `DATA` [role](../concepts/host-roles.md#data):

* Over the internet, if you configured public access for the appropriate host group.

* Over the internet using a [special FQDN](#special-fqdns) if you configured public access for the host group with the `DASHBOARDS` [role](../concepts/host-roles.md#dashboards).


* From {{ yandex-cloud }} VMs residing in the same [virtual network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md).


Regardless of the connection method, {{ mos-name }} only supports cluster host connections with an [SSL certificate](#ssl-certificate).


## Configuring security groups {#security-groups}

{% include notitle [Configuring security groups](../../_includes/mdb/mos/configuring-security-groups.md) %}


## Getting an SSL certificate {#ssl-certificate}

To use an encrypted connection, get an SSL certificate:

{% include [install-certificate](../../_includes/mdb/mos/install-certificate.md) %}

## {{ OS }} host FQDN {#fqdn}

To connect to a host, you need its fully qualified domain name ([FQDN](../concepts/network.md#hostname)). You can use the FQDN of a particular host in the cluster or a [special FQDN](#special-fqdns) always pointing to the available host with the `DASHBOARDS` role.

Example of the host FQDN:

```text
{{ host-name }}.{{ dns-zone }}
```

### Getting a host FQDN {#get-fqdn}

You can obtain the {{ OS }} host FQDN by doing one of the following:

* Look up the FQDN in the management console:

    1. Navigate to the cluster page.
    1. Navigate to **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.cluster.hosts.label_title }}**.
    1. Copy the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.cluster.hosts.host_column_name }}** column value.

* In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), copy the command for connecting to the cluster. This command contains the host FQDN. To get the command, go to the cluster page and click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.clusters.button_action-connect }}**.

* [Request a list of cluster hosts](host-groups.md#list-hosts) using the CLI or API.

### Special FQDN {#special-fqdns}

An FQDN in `c-<cluster_ID>.rw.{{ dns-zone }}` format always points to the available {{ OS }} host with the `DASHBOARDS` role in the cluster. You can get the cluster ID with the [list of clusters in the folder](./cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

You can connect to hosts with the `DATA` role using a special FQDN with port `9200`. In which case the load balancer located on the host with the `DASHBOARDS` role will redirect the request to one of the hosts with the `DATA` role using the [Round-Robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_scheduling) balancing algorithm. To make such connection scheme work, the cluster must have at least one host with the `DASHBOARDS` role.

You can use a special FQDN to send requests to a specific host group with the `DATA` role. To do this, add the `X-Yandex-OpenSearch-NodeGroup=<host_group_name>` header to the request.

You can request the name of the host group with [cluster details](cluster-list.md#get-cluster).

In clusters with multiple `DATA ` or `DASHBOARDS` hosts, a special FQDN may temporarily point to an unavailable host (for up to 10 minutes). This is because it takes time to update DNS record for special FQDNs. If your request fails, returning an error, repeat it later.

{% note warning %}

Use special FQDN-based connections only for processes that can cope with indexes being unavailable for writing for up to 10 minutes.

{% endnote %}

## Connecting to {{ OS }} Dashboards {#dashboards}


You can connect to {{ OS }} Dashboards:

* Over the internet if public access is enabled for a host with the `DASHBOARDS` role.
* Via a VM instance in {{ yandex-cloud }} if public access is not enabled for any of your hosts with the `DASHBOARDS` role.

{% list tabs group=connection_method %}

- Over the internet {#internet}

    1. Install the [SSL certificate](#ssl-certificate) in your browser's trusted root certificate store ([instructions](https://wiki.mozilla.org/PSM:Changing_Trust_Settings#Trusting_an_Additional_Root_Certificate) for Mozilla Firefox).
    1. On the cluster page in the management console, click **OpenSearch Dashboards** or go to `https://c-<cluster_ID>.rw.{{ dns-zone }}>` in your browser.

        You can get the cluster ID with the [list of clusters in the folder](./cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

    1. Enter `admin` for username and the password you set when [creating the cluster](cluster-create.md).

- From a VM in {{ yandex-cloud }} {#cloud}

    1. [Create](../../compute/quickstart/quick-create-linux.md) a Linux VM in the same [virtual network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md) as the cluster.
    1. [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) to the virtual machine over SSH.
    1. Install the dependencies:
    
       ```bash
       sudo apt update && \
       sudo apt install --yes nginx ssl-cert
       ```

    1. Copy the downloaded SSL certificate to the `/etc/nginx/` directory:

       ```bash
       sudo cp ~/.opensearch/root.crt /etc/nginx/root.crt
       ```

    1. Edit the NGINX default configuration file, for example, like this:

       `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`

       ```nginx
       upstream os-dashboards-nodes {
          server <FQDN_of_host_1_with_DASHBOARDS_role>:443;
          ...
          server <FQDN_of_host_N_with_DASHBOARDS_role>:443;
       }

       server {
          listen 443 ssl;

          ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem;
          ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key;

          server_name _;

          location / {

              proxy_pass https://os-dashboards-nodes;

              proxy_ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/nginx/root.crt;
              proxy_ssl_session_reuse on;
          }
       }
       ```

       {% note warning %}

       This configuration file example uses a self-signed `snakeoil` certificate from the `ssl-cert` package. It is not safe to use this certificate in a real cluster. Instead of the self-signed certificate, specify the path to your public and private SSL certificate keys in the `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` directives.

       {% endnote %}

    1. Restart NGINX:

       ```bash
       sudo systemctl restart nginx
       ```

    1. Add the certificate specified in the `ssl_certificate` directive to the browser's trusted root certificate store ([instructions](https://wiki.mozilla.org/PSM:Changing_Trust_Settings#Trusting_an_Additional_Root_Certificate) for Mozilla Firefox).

    1. In your browser, go to `https://<VM_public_IP_address>`.

    1. Enter the username and password for the `admin` user.

{% endlist %}


{% note info %}

When using the {{ OS }} Dashboards API:

* To send requests, use `{{ port-https }}` for port instead of the standard `5601`.
* Add the SSL certificate path to your application's configuration to use the API.

{% endnote %}

## Before you connect from a Docker container {#connection-docker}

To connect to a {{ mos-name }} cluster from a Docker container, add the following lines to the Dockerfile:

{% list tabs group=connection %}


- Connecting without SSL {#without-ssl}

    ```bash
    RUN apt-get update && \
        apt-get install curl --yes
    ```


- Connecting via SSL {#with-ssl}

    ```bash
    RUN apt-get update && \
        apt-get install wget curl --yes && \
        mkdir --parents ~/.opensearch && \
        wget "{{ crt-web-path }}" \
             --output-document ~/.opensearch/root.crt && \
        chmod 0600 ~/.opensearch/root.crt
    ```

{% endlist %}

## Examples of connection strings {#code-examples}

Before connecting, [prepare a certificate](#ssl-cetificate).

To connect, enter `admin` for username and the password you set when [creating the cluster](cluster-create.md#create-cluster).
