# Access management in {{ mspqr-name }}


In this section, you will learn:

* [What resources you can assign a role for](#resources).
* [What roles exist in this service](#roles-list).
* [What roles are required](#required-roles) for specific actions.

{% include [about-access-management](../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

To assign a role for a resource, a user should have the `mdb.admin` role, `managed-spqr.admin` role, or one of the following roles for that resource:

## What roles are required {#required-roles}

To use the service, you need the [managed-spqr.editor role or higher](../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) for the folder to house the new cluster. The `managed-spqr.viewer` role only allows you to view the list of clusters.

To create a {{ mspqr-name }} cluster, you need the [{{ roles-vpc-user }}](../vpc/security/index.md#vpc-user) role and the `managed-spqr.editor` role or higher.

You can always assign a role with more permissions. For example, you can assign the `managed-spqr.admin` role instead of `managed-spqr.editor`.
