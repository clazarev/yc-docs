# Access requests

## Approving or rejecting a request {#approve-reject}

If you opted for `Product access on request` when creating your product, you must approve the request before the user can install your product. To work with requests, you need the `marketplace.productAccessRequests.publisher` role.

To approve or reject a request:

1. Log in to the [{{ marketplace-short-name }}]({{ link-cloud-partners }}) partner dashboard.
1. Select the product you want to approve or reject a request for.
1. Navigate to the **User access requests** tab.
1. Select a request.
1. Find out why the user needs this product and whether they have questions for you or you have questions for the user. If you have any questions, write a message to the user in the **Request messages** field and click **Send**.
1. If you have no questions and:
   * You want to give the user access to the product, click **Approve**.
   * You do not want to give the user access to the product, click **Reject**.

## Revoking product access {#revoke-access}

If required, you can revoke the user's granted access to the product. To do this, write to your {{ yandex-cloud }} manager and provide the reasons why you want to revoke access.

If you revoke access from a user, they can only regain it by submitting a new request.

To find out which users have access to your product:

1. Log in to the [{{ marketplace-short-name }}]({{ link-cloud-partners }}) partner dashboard.
1. Choose a product.
1. Navigate to the **Product users** tab.
