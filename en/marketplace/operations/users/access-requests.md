# Requesting product access

To start using certain products in {{ marketplace-name }}, you must submit an access request and wait for it to be approved first. This requirement is due to our security standards.

Only users with the `marketplace.productAccessRequests.editor` role for the organization can submit access requests.

## On the {{ marketplace-name }} website {#marketplace}

1. On the [{{ marketplace-name }}](/marketplace) homepage, select the product you want to access.
1. Click **Request access from publisher**.
1. {% include [access-request-steps](../../../_includes/marketplace/access-request-steps.md) %}

## On the **Available products** page in the management console {#console-products}

1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), click the {{ marketplace-name }} solutions panel at the top of the screen.
1. In the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/circles-4-square.svg) **Available products**.
1. Select the product you want to access.
1. Click **Request access from publisher**.
1. {% include [access-request-steps](../../../_includes/marketplace/access-request-steps.md) %}
