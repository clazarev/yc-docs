At the [Preview](../overview/concepts/launch-stages.md) stage, {{ metadata-hub-full-name }} is free of charge.

Other {{ yandex-cloud }} resources you will use to manage connections (e.g., managed database or [{{ lockbox-name }}](../lockbox/pricing.md) services) are subject to their own [pricing plans]({{ link-cloud-calculator }}).

You can use {{ connection-manager-name }} free of charge.
