# Getting started as a metadata analyst



{% include notitle [preview](../../_includes/note-preview.md) %}



Using {{ data-catalog-full-name }} as a metadata analyst, you can analyze and visualize metadata on {{ yandex-cloud }} objects and links between them.

To get started:

1. [View the metadata catalog](#open-data-catalog).
1. [View the metadata information](#view-metadata).
1. [Find metadata using search](#search-data).
1. [Configure metadata filters](#create-filters).
1. [View marked up resources](#view-markup-data).

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

1. Navigate to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) and log in to {{ yandex-cloud }} or sign up if not signed up yet.

1. Contact your working cloud or organization administrator for access to the resource catalog the metadata is processed in.

1. Make sure your account has the `data-catalog.dataConsumer` role for the working catalog to view and update {{ data-catalog-name }} resources.

    If you do not have the role, contact the metadata catalog administrator in your cloud or organization.

1. Check with your cloud or organization administrator as to which metadata catalog you should be using.

     You can increase the number of available filters by carefully selecting your data types.
