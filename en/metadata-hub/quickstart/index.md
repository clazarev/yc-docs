# Getting started with {{ metadata-hub-full-name }} services

{{ metadata-hub-full-name }} allows you to manage data in {{ yandex-cloud }}. You can:

* Create database connections and manage their parameters.
* Get and store data exchange schemas and check their evolution.
* Get, categorize, and visualize metadata about data storages and links between them.

Get started with {{ metadata-hub-name }} tools:

* [{{ connection-manager-full-name }}](connection-manager.md). Use it to manage database connection parameters. For more information on {{ connection-manager-name }} features, see [Concepts](../concepts/connection-manager.md).

* [{{ metastore-full-name }}](metastore.md). Use it to manage data in applications supporting integration with {{ metastore-name }}. For more information about {{ metastore-name }} clusters, see [Concepts](../concepts/metastore.md).

* {{ preview-stage }} [{{ schema-registry-name }}](schema-registry.md). You can use it to create subjects and schemas for management purposes, set schema evolution parameters, add references, and compare schema versions. For more information about schema registry, see [Concepts](../concepts/schema-registry.md).


* {{ preview-stage }} {{ data-catalog-name }}. You can use it to [mark up](../quickstart/data-steward-quickstart.md) and [analyze](../quickstart/data-analyst-quickstart.md) metadata on {{ yandex-cloud }} objects and links between them. For more information about data catalogs, see the [Concepts](../concepts/data-catalog.md).

  You can access Data Catalog in any of these roles:

  * [Metadata steward](data-steward-quickstart.md)
  * [Metadata analyst](data-analyst-quickstart.md)
