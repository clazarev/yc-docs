# Pricing policy

## Service plans {#plans}

* _Pay As You Go (PAYG)_: You are only charged for actual usage. {{ price-per-hour-count-per-second }}
* _Bring Your Own License (BYOL)_: This pricing model available for some products allows you to run software on the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure using the licenses purchased from third-party providers. You are only charged for using {{ yandex-cloud }} resources, which means you can buy your own licenses and manage them. For more information about license mobility in {{ yandex-cloud }}, see [Microsoft licenses](licensing.md#mobility).

## Computing resources {#compute}

The total cost depends on the resources you use. To learn more, refer to [{#T}](../compute/pricing.md).

## Minimum configuration {#config}

The minimum configuration required for running the selected product is set automatically. You can check the cost of the configuration you need using [our calculator]({{ link-cloud-calculator }}).
