# Network load balancer types

{% note info %}

{% include [type-update](../../_includes/network-load-balancer/type-update.md) %}

{% endnote %}

Here are the options for deploying a network load balancer in {{ yandex-cloud }}:

* External load balancer (`EXTERNAL`), which is created by default. It is used to handle Internet traffic.
* Internal load balancer (`INTERNAL`), which is used to handle internal {{ vpc-name }} traffic.

These load balancers operate similarly, but you should keep the following distinctions in mind:

| **Load balancer property** | **External** | **Internal**
| --- | --- | --- |
| Listener IP address | [Public](../../vpc/concepts/ips.md) IP addresses only | IP addresses from [RFC-1918](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt) only |
| Blocking the listener target port for traffic on target VMs | Active (*) | Blocked | 
| Blocking the listener target port for health checks on target VMs | Active | Blocked |
| Locality in traffic processing | - | [Considerations apply](./specifics.md#nlb-int-locality) |
| Use of static routes | - | [Considerations apply](./specifics.md#nlb-int-routing) |

Explanation of the table:
* The VM ports (Target-Port) used to receive traffic from the internal load balancer and health checks become unavailable for connecting.
The VMs will only receive traffic from the internal load balancer. The same restriction will not allow a VM from the load balancer's target group to access it through the port being used.
* (*) A VM from the load balancer's target group cannot access itself through the target port.
