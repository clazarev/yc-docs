If `done == true`, exactly one of `error` or `response` is set. ||
|| response | **[Userpool](#yandex.cloud.organizationmanager.v1.idp.Userpool)**

The normal response of the operation in case of success.
If the original method returns no data on success, such as Delete,
the response is [google.protobuf.Empty](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.Empty).
If the original method is the standard Create/Update,
the response should be the target resource of the operation.
Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the response type, if any.
