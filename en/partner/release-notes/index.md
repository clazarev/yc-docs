# Partner portal release notes

## Q3 2025 {#q3-2025}

Updated partner portal navigation.

1. The following sections are now available:

   * **Search documentation**: Opens a search bar where you can enter a query and get a generative response based on the [partner program](../quickstart.md) documentation. The response is generated in {{ search-api }}.

   * **Accounts**: Tool for managing your customer base. In this section, you can maintain a list of all potential and current customers as well as their associated subaccounts. For convenience, we added the ability to apply filters and save filter parameters. It is also now possible to create subaccounts from accounts without having to duplicate account data.

   * **Finances**: Section for tracking commissions, accrual balances, and partner bonuses. Improved usage details: now you can break down data by subaccounts, products, services, clouds, and folders.

   * **Partner profile**: Section with information about the master account and specializations. Here, you can also manage your profile and products in the partner catalog.

1. Updated the **Subaccounts** section with a new section, **Quotas and instances**. In this section, you can view instances associated with your subaccount: clouds and individual {{ yandex-cloud }} services, such as {{ datalens-name }}, etc. Additionally, you can manage resource availability by setting cloud quotas. To set up limitations for individual services and subaccounts, contact [support](../../support/).

1. Removed the **Dashboard** section. Its former subsections, **Subaccounts** and **Access management**, are now standalone sections.
