## Quality of service (QoS) level {#qos}

When delivering notifications, {{ postbox-name }} supports the `QoS 1: At least once` service level, which means the notifications may be sent again. Identical notifications have the same `eventId`.

If an address is linked to a [configuration](glossary.md#configuration) that has multiple [subscriptions](glossary.md#subscription.md) added to it, a separate notification will come for each assignment.

## Use case {#example}

You sent an email to two recipients: `user1@example.com` and `user2@other.example.com`. {{ postbox-name }} sent it to both recipients separately.

The email client of `user1@example.com` accepted the email. The email client of the recipient `user2@other.example.com` returned an error after the first attempt to send the email and declined to accept the email after the second attempt, replying that the user was not found.

In which case you will get these three notifications:
* Notification that {{ postbox-name }} accepted the email for processing.
* Notification that the email was delivered to `user1@example.com`.
* Notification that the email was not delivered to `user2@other.example.com` with the error info. The notification will come after the second attempt to send the email.

Since the mail client responded that the recipient `user2@other.example.com` was not found, the address will be temporarily put on the stop list. You should wait for some time before trying to reach the address again, otherwise you will get notified that your message was not delivered because the recipient was on the stop list.
