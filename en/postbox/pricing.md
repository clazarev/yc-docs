# {{ postbox-name }} pricing policy


{% note tip %}




To calculate the cost of using the service, use [our calculator](https://yandex.cloud/en/prices?state=d41eb2e392e8#calculator) on the {{ yandex-cloud }} website or check out the pricing below.


{% endnote %}




{{ postbox-name }} cost depends on the number of sent emails per month. All emails accepted for sending are charged, regardless of whether they have been actually delivered. If one email is sent to multiple recipients, the number of outbound emails is the same as the number of such recipients.

{% note info %}

By default, {{ postbox-name }} has quotas (e.g., on the number of emails you send), which you can increase by requesting support. For more information, see [{#T}](concepts/limits.md).
