# Access management in {{ si-name }}

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

Roles for a resource can be assigned by users who have one of the following roles for that resource:

{% include [roles-list](../../_includes/iam/roles-list.md) %}

Also, only a user with the `serverless.eventrouter.admin` role for an {{ er-name }} [bus](../concepts/eventrouter/bus.md), [connector](../concepts/eventrouter/connector.md), or [rule](../concepts/eventrouter/rule.md) can assign roles for these resources.

## Resources you can assign a role for {#resources}

{% include [basic-resources](../../_includes/iam/basic-resources-for-access-control.md) %}

You can use the {{ yandex-cloud }} [CLI](../../cli/index.yaml) or [API](../../api-design-guide/index.yaml) to assign roles for individual service resources:
* [Bus](../concepts/eventrouter/bus.md)
* [Connector](../concepts/eventrouter/connector.md)
* [Rule](../concepts/eventrouter/rule.md)

## Roles existing in {{ si-name }} {#roles-list}

You can use {{ si-name }} roles (_service roles_) and {{ yandex-cloud }} roles (_primitive roles_) to manage access permissions.

### Service roles {#service-roles}

{{ yandex-cloud }} supports a separate list of roles for each {{ si-name }} component. For more information, see:

* [Roles to work with {{ er-full-name }}](./eventrouter.md).
* [Roles to work with {{ sw-full-name }}](./workflows.md).
* [Roles to work with {{ api-gw-full-name }}](../../api-gateway/security/index.md#service-roles).

### Primitive roles {#primitive-roles}

{% include [roles-primitive](../../_includes/roles-primitive.md) %}

{% include [primitive-roles-footnote](../../_includes/primitive-roles-footnote.md) %}
