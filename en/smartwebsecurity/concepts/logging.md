# Logging

{% include [logging-preview](../../_includes/smartwebsecurity/logging-preview.md) %}

{{ sws-name }} allows you to collect and view service logs to configure protection and monitor security events.

There are two options for collecting logs: via {{ sws-name }} and via an L7 {{ alb-name }} the security profile is connected to.

This section provides information on logging via {{ sws-name }}. If you want to learn about collecting logs via an L7 balancer, see [{#T}](../operations/configure-logging-alb.md).

These logs contain information about all HTTP requests processed by {{ sws-name }}. You can set up logging only for requests that were blocked (the `DENY` verdict) or sent to CAPTCHA (the `CAPTCHA` verdict). Additionally, you can collect logs for legitimate requests that were allowed by {{ sws-name }} (the `ALLOW` verdict). To avoid overflowing logs with allowed requests, specify the percentage of logs that the system will collect, from 1 to 100 %.

{{ sws-name }} delivers logs in JSON format. Each log entry contains the following structural blocks: 

1. Log system fields that contain service information of the monitoring system. Only one field is significant for analysis: the `time` the event occurred in the protected system, with nanosecond precision.
1. `labels` block: Set of `<name>=<value>` pairs for log identification and quick filtering by different slices. You can also use top-level fields for filtering.
1. `message` block: Short text log message in [Unicode](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) format.
1. `meta` block: Request metadata, which is detailed parameters of triggered rules and request parameters.
   
The description of SWS log fields is given in the table below.

To analyze {{ sws-name }} logs, make requests that include the fields and field combinations you need. Check the examples of ready-made requests in [{#T}](../operations/configure-logging.md#filtration).

## Using logs when setting up protection {#log-uses}

To ensure {{ sws-name }} does not disrupt your service availability while maintaining an adequate level of protection:

1. Enable logging in your security profile.
1. Set all rules to **{{ ui-key.yacloud.smart-web-security.overview.column_dry-run-rule }}** mode.
1. Check the logs for correct traffic filtering.
1. After checking, disable the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.smart-web-security.overview.column_dry-run-rule }}** mode.

Each time you update or add security profile, WAF, or ARL rules, enable the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.smart-web-security.overview.column_dry-run-rule }}** mode. Activate a rule only after the logs confirm that it works correctly.
