# Migrating to WAF with Yandex rule set support

Web Application Firewall analyzes requests to your resources using rule sets. Previously, only one rule set was available: [OWASP Core Ruleset](https://coreruleset.org). Starting September 9, 2025, two new rule sets developed by Yandex are also available: Yandex Ruleset and ML WAF (Yandex Malicious Score).

To support new rule sets, the `coreRuleSet` object in the WAF interfaces will get a mandatory field: `ruleSet`.`type`. The `coreRuleSet` section will be nested into the `ruleSet` section, which sets the `priority` for processing a request by a rule set.

The `type` field may get the following values:

* `CORE`: OWASP Core rule set.
* `YA`: Yandex rule set.
* `ML`: ML WAF (Yandex Malicious Score) rule set.

By default, the `type` field will have the `RULE_SET_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED` value, which means the requests will not be checked by any rule set.

To continue working with WAF, add this new field to the [API](../api-ref/authentication.md) function calls or [{{ TF }}](../tf-ref.md) manifest. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), you will not to do anything, since all changes will be applied automatically.

{% note warning %}

Starting September 9, 2025, the `type` field will become mandatory, while the `ruleSet` description will be only accepted in the new format. The previous format will no longer be supported.
