# Authentication with the {{ sk-hybrid-name }} API

When using {{ sk-hybrid-name }}, authentication is not required for operations via the API.

However, when using the [Cloud Billing licensing model](pricing.md#billing), you need an [API key](../iam/concepts/authorization/api-key.md) to authenticate in the cloud.
