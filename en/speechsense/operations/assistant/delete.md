# Deleting an assistant

To delete an assistant, you need either the `{{ roles-speechsense-admin }}` or the `{{ roles-speechsense-editor }}` role in the project.

To delete an assistant:

1. Open the {{ speechsense-name }} [home page]({{ link-speechsense-main }}).
1. Go to the space you need and select a project.
1. Go to the **Assistants** tab.
1. Click ![icon](../../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) next to the assistant, then click ![icon](../../../_assets/console-icons/trash-bin.svg) **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-talkanalytics.common.delete-key-value }}**.
1. Confirm the assistant deletion.
