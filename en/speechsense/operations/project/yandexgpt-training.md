# {{ yagpt-name }} training

[{{ yagpt-name }}](../../../ai-studio/concepts/generation/models.md) is used in {{ speechsense-name }} [dialogs](../../concepts/dialogs.md) for data analysis. To increase the analysis quality, e.g., assign semantics tags or perform audio recognition, {{ yagpt-name }} models can be trained on your project data.

Starting September 1, 2025, {{ yagpt-name }} training is enabled by default in new projects. You can [disable](#disable-yandexgpt-training) it if you prefer to opt out. For projects created before September 1, 2025, you need to [enable](#enable-yandexgpt-training) {{ yagpt-name }} training manually.

Data collection starts once you enable training, and the {{ yagpt-name }} model gets updated every three months based on the collected data. The result of model training will only be integrated into your project.

To enable or disable {{ yagpt-name }} training, you need the `{{ roles-speechsense-admin }}` role in the space.
