# Renaming and moving objects


{% include [encryption-roles](../../../_includes/storage/encryption-roles.md) %}


In addition to the {{ yandex-cloud }} CLI and AWS CLI, you can also use other [supported tools](../../../storage/tools/index.md), such as a file browser, to rename and move objects.

## Renaming {#rename}

{% note info %}

You can rename [objects](../../concepts/object.md) in the [bucket](../../concepts/bucket.md). You cannot rename the bucket itself. However, you can [create](../buckets/create.md) a new bucket and [copy](./copy.md#copy-from-bucket-to-bucket) all objects from the source bucket into it.

{% endnote %}

- {{ yandex-cloud }} CLI {#cli}

  {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  1. See the description of the CLI command for renaming an object in a bucket:

      ```bash
      yc storage s3 mv --help
      ```

  1. {% include [bucket-list-cli](../../../_includes/storage/bucket-list-cli.md) %}
  1. Run this command:

      ```bash
      yc storage s3 mv \
        s3://<bucket_name>/<object_key> \
        s3://<bucket_name>/<new_object_key>
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      move: s3://my-bucket/object.txt to s3://my-bucket/renamed-object.txt
      ```

  For more information about the `yc storage s3 mv` command, see the [documentation](../../cli-ref/s3/mv.md).

- AWS CLI {#aws-cli}

  1. If you do not have the AWS CLI yet, [install and configure it](../../tools/aws-cli.md).
  1. To rename an object, run this command:

      ```bash
      aws --endpoint-url=https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/ \
        s3 mv s3://<bucket_name>/<object_key> s3://<bucket_name>/<new_object_key>
      ```

      Where:

      * `--endpoint-url`: {{ objstorage-name }} endpoint.
      * `s3 mv`: Command to rename or move an object. To rename an object, in the first part of the command, provide the bucket name and the current [key](../../concepts/object.md#key) of the object you want to rename, and in the second part, the bucket name and the new object key.

      Result:

      ```text
      move: s3://<bucket_name>/<object_key> to s3://<bucket_name>/<new_object_key>
      ```

  For more information about the `aws s3 mv` command, see [this article](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3/mv.html) in the AWS CLI command reference.

  ```bash
  yc storage s3 mv --recursive \
    s3://<bucket_name>/<prefix>/ \

  ```

  Result:

  ```text
  move: s3://my-bucket/my-prefix/ to s3://my-bucket/renamed-prefix/
  ```

  For more information about the `yc storage s3 mv` command, see the [documentation](../../cli-ref/s3/mv.md).

        s3 mv --recursive s3://<bucket_name>/<prefix>/ s3://<bucket_name>/<new_prefix>/
      ```

      Where: 

      * `--endpoint-url`: {{ objstorage-name }} endpoint.
      * `s3 mv`: Command to rename or move an object. To rename an object, in the first part of the command, provide the bucket name and the current [prefix](../../concepts/object.md#key) of the object group you want to rename, and in the second part, the bucket name and the new prefix for the object group.
      * `--recursive`: Parameter for updating the prefix for an object group.

      Result:

      ```text
      move: s3://<bucket_name>/<prefix>/ to s3://<bucket_name>/<new_prefix>/
      ```

### Moving an object from one directory to another {#move-object-folder}

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- {{ yandex-cloud }} CLI {#cli}

  ```bash
  yc storage s3 mv \
    s3://<bucket_name>/<prefix>/<object_name> \
    s3://<bucket_name>/<new_prefix>/<object_name>

  Result:

  ```text
  move: s3://my-bucket/my-prefix/object.txt to s3://my-bucket/renamed-prefix/object.txt
  ```

- AWS CLI {#aws-cli}

  ```bash
  aws --endpoint-url=https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/ \

  move: s3://my-bucket/my-prefix/object.txt to s3://my-bucket/renamed-prefix/object.txt
  ```  

{% endlist %}

### Moving a directory with objects {#move-folder}

In {{ objstorage-name }}, [directories](../../concepts/object.md#folder) are simulated using key prefixes. To move a directory with objects, [update](#rename-prefix) the prefix for an object group.
