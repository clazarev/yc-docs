# upload method

Uploads an object and its metadata to {{ objstorage-full-name }}.

{% note info %}

{{ objstorage-name }} does not block objects for writes and can accept multiple write requests to the same object at once. However, the user can only get the last written object from {{ objstorage-name }} by default. Enable [versioning](../../../concepts/versioning.md) to ensure that the history is saved when objects are overwritten or deleted.

{% endnote %}

To make sure an object has been delivered via the network uncorrupted, use the `Content-MD5` header. {{ objstorage-name }} will calculate the `MD5` value for the saved object. If this `MD5` value does not match the value provided in the header, it will return an error. You can also perform this check on the client side by comparing the `ETag` from the {{ objstorage-name }} response with the precalculated `MD5` value.

{% note warning %}

If [default object locks](../../../concepts/object-lock.md#default) are configured in the bucket, the `Content-MD5` header is required.

## Request {#request}

```http
PUT /{bucket}/{key} HTTP/2
```

### Path parameters {#path-parameters}

Parameter | Description
----- | -----
`bucket` | Bucket name.
`key` | Object key, which is the ID the object is saved with in {{ objstorage-name }}.


### Headers {#request-headers}

Use the appropriate [common headers](../common-request-headers.md) in your request.

You can also use the headers listed in the table below.


Header | Description
----- | -----
`If-Match` | Defines the condition for performing an operation. The operation will only be performed if the current version of the object matching the specified key exists and its `ETag` is identical to the value in the `If-Match` header.
`If-None-Match` | Defines the condition for performing an operation. The operation will only be performed if there is no object with the same key in the bucket. Specify `*` in the header value.
`X-Amz-Meta-*` | User-defined object metadata.<br/><br/>{{ objstorage-name }} converts all headers starting with `X-Amz-Meta-` as follows: `X-Amz-Meta-foo-bar_baz` â†’ `X-Amz-Meta-Foo-Bar_baz`.<br/><br/>The total size of user-defined headers must not exceed 2 KB. The size of user-defined data is determined as the length of the UTF-8 encoded string. The size includes header names and their values.
`X-Amz-Storage-Class` | Object [storage class](../../../concepts/storage-class.md).<br/><br/>Possible values:<ul><li>`STANDARD`: Standard storage</li><li>`COLD`, `STANDARD_IA`, or `NEARLINE`: Cold storage</li><li>`ICE` or `GLACIER`: Ice storage</li></ul>If the header is not specified, the object is stored in the storage defined in the bucket settings.
`X-Amz-Server-Side-Encryption` | The uploaded object's encryption algorithm. Values to choose from: `aws:kms`.
`X-Amz-Server-Side-Encryption-Aws-Kms-Key-Id` | ID of the [{{ kms-short-name }} key](../../../../kms/concepts/key.md) for encrypting an uploaded object.
`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Mode` | <p>Type of [retention](../../../concepts/object-lock.md) put on the object (if the bucket is [versioned](../../../concepts/versioning.md) and object lock is enabled in it):</p><ul><li>`GOVERNANCE`: Governance-mode retention.</li><li>`COMPLIANCE`: Compliance-mode retention.</li></ul><p>For an object version, you can use only retention (the `X-Amz-Object-Lock-Mode` and `X-Amz-Object-Lock-Retain-Until-Date` headers), only legal hold (`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Legal-Hold`), or both at the same time. For more information about their combined use, see [{#T}](../../../concepts/object-lock.md#types).</p>
`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Retain-Until-Date` | Retention end date and time in any format described in the [HTTP standard](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#name-date-time-formats), e.g., `Mon, 12 Dec 2022 09:00:00 GMT`. Specify it only with the `X-Amz-Object-Lock-Mode` header.
`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Legal-Hold` | <p>Type of [legal hold](../../../concepts/object-lock.md) put on the object (if the bucket is [versioned](../../../concepts/versioning.md) and object lock is enabled in it):</p><ul><li>`ON`: Enabled.</li><li>`OFF`: Disabled.</li></ul><p>For an object version, you can use only retention (the `X-Amz-Object-Lock-Mode` and `X-Amz-Object-Lock-Retain-Until-Date` headers), only legal hold (`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Legal-Hold`), or both at the same time. For more information about their combined use, see [{#T}](../../../concepts/object-lock.md#types).</p>


The headers below enable you to set the [ACL](../../../concepts/acl.md) for the object being uploaded.
