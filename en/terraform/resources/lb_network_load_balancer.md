# yandex_lb_network_load_balancer (Resource)

Creates a network load balancer in the specified folder using the data specified in the config. For more information, see [the official documentation](https://yandex.cloud/docs/load-balancer/concepts).

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new Network Load Balancer (NLB).
//
resource "yandex_lb_network_load_balancer" "my_nlb" {
  name = "my-network-load-balancer"

  listener {
    name = "my-listener"
    port = 8080
    external_address_spec {
      ip_version = "ipv4"
    }
  }

  attached_target_group {
    target_group_id = yandex_lb_target_group.my-target-group.id

    healthcheck {
      name = "http"
      http_options {
        port = 8080
        path = "/ping"
      }
    }
  }
}

## Import

The resource can be imported by using their `resource ID`. For getting the resource ID you can use Yandex Cloud [Web Console](https://console.yandex.cloud) or [YC CLI](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cli/quickstart).

```shell
# terraform import yandex_lb_network_load_balancer.<resource Name> <resource Id>
terraform import yandex_lb_network_load_balancer.my_nlb ...
```
