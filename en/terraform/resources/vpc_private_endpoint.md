# yandex_vpc_private_endpoint (Resource)

Manages a VPC Private Endpoint within the Yandex Cloud. For more information, see [the official documentation](https://yandex.cloud/docs/vpc/concepts/private-endpoint).

* How-to Guides
  * [Cloud Networking](https://yandex.cloud/docs/vpc/)

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new VPC Private Endpoint.
//
resource "yandex_vpc_private_endpoint" "my_pe" {
  name        = "object-storage-private-endpoint"
  description = "description for private endpoint"

  labels = {
    my-label = "my-label-value"
  }

  network_id = yandex_vpc_network.lab-net.id

  object_storage {}

  dns_options {
    private_dns_records_enabled = true
  }

  endpoint_address {
    subnet_id = yandex_vpc_subnet.lab-subnet-a.id
  }
}

// Auxiliary resources
resource "yandex_vpc_network" "lab-net" {
  name = "lab-network"
}

resource "yandex_vpc_subnet" "lab-subnet-a" {
  v4_cidr_blocks = ["10.2.0.0/16"]
  zone           = "ru-central1-a"
  network_id     = yandex_vpc_network.lab-net.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `network_id` (String) ID of the network which private endpoint belongs to.
- `object_storage` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) Private endpoint for Object Storage. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--object_storage))

### Optional

- `description` (String) The resource description.
- `dns_options` (Block List, Max: 1) Private endpoint DNS options block. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--dns_options))
- `endpoint_address` (Block List, Max: 1) Private endpoint address specification block.

{% note warning %}

Only one of `address_id` or `subnet_id` + `address` arguments can be specified. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--endpoint_address))

{% endnote %}

- `folder_id` (String) The folder identifier that resource belongs to. If it is not provided, the default provider `folder-id` is used.
- `labels` (Map of String) A set of key/value label pairs which assigned to resource.
- `name` (String) The resource name.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Nested Schema for `dns_options`

Optional:

- `private_dns_records_enabled` (Boolean) If enabled - additional service DNS will be created.

### Nested Schema for `endpoint_address`

Optional:

- `address` (String) Specifies IP address within `subnet_id`.
- `address_id` (String) ID of the address.
- `subnet_id` (String) Subnet of the IP address.


<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

The resource can be imported by using their `resource ID`. For getting the resource ID you can use Yandex Cloud [Web Console](https://console.yandex.cloud) or [YC CLI](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cli/quickstart).

```shell
# terraform import yandex_vpc_private_endpoint.<resource Name> <resource Id>
terraform import yandex_vpc_private_endpoint.my_pe ...
```
