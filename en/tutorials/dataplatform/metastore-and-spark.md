description: This tutorial walks you through an example of using a PySpark job to create a database and a table within it, and then loading the data from the created database into a {{ objstorage-full-name }} bucket. Database metadata is stored in a {{ metastore-name }} cluster connected to your {{ SPRK }} cluster.
