# yandex_iam_policy (Data Source)

Generates an [IAM](https://yandex.cloud/docs/iam/) policy document that may be referenced by and applied to other Yandex Cloud Platform resources, such as the `yandex_resourcemanager_folder` resource.

This data source is used to define [IAM](https://yandex.cloud/docs/iam/) policies to apply to other resources. Currently, defining a policy through a data source and referencing that policy from another resource is the only way to apply an IAM policy to a resource.

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Get information about existing IAM Policy.
//
data "yandex_iam_policy" "admin" {
  binding {
    role = "admin"

    members = [
      "userAccount:user_id_1"
    ]
  }

  binding {
    role = "viewer"

    members = [
      "userAccount:user_id_2"
    ]
  }
}
```
