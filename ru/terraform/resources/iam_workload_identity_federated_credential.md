Allows management of [Yandex Cloud IAM federated credentials](https://yandex.cloud/docs/iam/concepts/workload-identity#federated-credentials).

```terraform
//
// Create a new IAM Workload Identity Federated Credential.
//
resource "yandex_iam_workload_identity_federated_credential" "fed_cred" {
  service_account_id  = "some_sa_id"
  federation_id       = "some_wli_federation_id"
  external_subject_id = "some_external_subject_id"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `external_subject_id` (String) Id of the workload identity federation which is used for authentication.
- `federation_id` (String) Id of the federated credential.

### Optional

- `service_account_id` (String) Id of the service account that the federated credential belongs to.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Id of the external subject.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
