# yandex_lockbox_secret (Resource)

Yandex Cloud Lockbox secret resource. For more information, see [the official documentation](https://yandex.cloud/docs/lockbox/). The created secret will contain a version with the generated password. You can use `yandex_lockbox_secret_version` to create new versions.

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new LockBox Secret.
//
resource "yandex_lockbox_secret" "my_secret" {
  name = "test secret"
}
```

```terraform
//
// Create a new LockBox Secret with password.
//
resource "yandex_lockbox_secret" "my_secret" {
  name = "test secret with passowrd"

  password_payload_specification {
    password_key = "some_password"
    length       = 12
  }
}
```
