# yandex_organizationmanager_group_mapping_item (Resource)

Allows management of [Yandex Cloud Organization Manager Group Mapping Items](https://yandex.cloud/docs/organization/concepts/add-federation#group-mapping)

.

## Example Usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new OrganizationManager Group Mapping Item.
//
resource "yandex_organizationmanager_group_mapping_item" "group_mapping_item" {
  federation_id     = "my-federation_id"
  internal_group_id = "my_internal_group_id"
  external_group_id = "my_external_group_id"

  depends_on = [yandex_organizationmanager_group_mapping.group_mapping]
}
```
