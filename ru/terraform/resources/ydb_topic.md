# yandex_ydb_topic (Resource)

Manage a YDB Topic. For more information, see [the official documentation](https://yandex.cloud/docs/ydb/concepts/#ydb).

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new YDB Topic.
//
resource "yandex_ydb_topic" "my_topic" {
  database_endpoint = yandex_ydb_database_serverless.database_name.ydb_full_endpoint
  name              = "topic-test"

  supported_codecs    = ["raw", "gzip"]
  partitions_count    = 1
  retention_period_ms = 2000000
  consumer {
    name                          = "consumer-name"
    supported_codecs              = ["raw", "gzip"]
    starting_message_timestamp_ms = 0
  }
}

resource "yandex_ydb_database_serverless" "database_name" {
  name        = "database-name"
  location_id = "ru-central1"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `database_endpoint` (String) YDB database endpoint.
- `name` (String) Topic name.

### Optional

- `auto_partitioning_settings` (Block List, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--auto_partitioning_settings))
- `consumer` (Block Set) Topic Readers. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--consumer))
- `description` (String) Topic description.
- `max_partitions_count` (Number) Number of max active partitions. Default value `1`.
- `metering_mode` (String) Resource metering mode (`reserved_capacity` - based on the allocated resources or `request_units` - based on actual usage). This option applies to topics in serverless databases.
- `partition_write_speed_kbps` (Number) Maximum allowed write speed per partition. If a write speed for a given partition exceeds this value, the write speed will be capped. Default value: `1024 (1MB)`.
- `partitions_count` (Number) Number of min partitions. Default value `1`.
- `retention_period_hours` (Number) Data retention time. Default value `86400000`.
- `retention_storage_mb` (Number)
- `supported_codecs` (Set of String) Supported data encodings. Can be one of `gzip`, `raw` or `zstd`.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--auto_partitioning_settings"></a>
### Nested Schema for `auto_partitioning_settings`

Optional:

- `auto_partitioning_strategy` (String) The auto partitioning strategy to use
- `auto_partitioning_write_speed_strategy` (Block List, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--auto_partitioning_settings--auto_partitioning_write_speed_strategy))

<a id="nestedblock--auto_partitioning_settings--auto_partitioning_write_speed_strategy"></a>
### Nested Schema for `auto_partitioning_settings.auto_partitioning_write_speed_strategy`

Optional:

- `down_utilization_percent` (Number) The down utilization percentage threshold
- `stabilization_window` (Number) The stabilization window in seconds
- `up_utilization_percent` (Number) The up utilization percentage threshold



<a id="nestedblock--consumer"></a>
### Nested Schema for `consumer`

Required:

- `name` (String) Reader's name.

Optional:

- `important` (Boolean) Defines an important consumer. No data will be deleted from the topic until all the important consumers read them. Default value `false`.
- `starting_message_timestamp_ms` (Number) Timestamp in UNIX timestamp format from which the reader will start reading data. Default value `0`.
- `supported_codecs` (Set of String) Supported data encodings. Can be one of `gzip`, `raw` or `zstd`.


<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `default` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

The resource can be imported by using their `resource ID`. For getting the resource ID you can use Yandex Cloud [Web Console](https://console.yandex.cloud) or [YC CLI](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cli/quickstart).

```shell
# terraform import yandex_ydb_topic.<resource Name> <resource Id>
terraform import yandex_ydb_topic.my_topic ...
```
