# yandex_iam_service_account_api_key (Resource)

Allows management of a [Yandex Cloud IAM service account API key](https://yandex.cloud/docs/iam/concepts/authorization/api-key). The API key is a private key used for simplified authorization in the Yandex Cloud API. API keys are only used for [service accounts](https://yandex.cloud/docs/iam/concepts/users/service-accounts).

API keys do not expire. This means that this authentication method is simpler, but less secure. Use it if you can't automatically request an [IAM token](https://yandex.cloud/docs/iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token).

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new IAM Service Account API Key.
//
resource "yandex_iam_service_account_api_key" "sa-api-key" {
  service_account_id = "aje5a**********qspd3"
  description        = "api key for authorization"
  scopes             = ["yc.ydb.topics.manage", "yc.ydb.tables.manage"]
  expires_at         = "2024-11-11T00:00:00Z"
  pgp_key            = "keybase:keybaseusername"
}
```
