# yandex_iam_service_account_iam_binding (Resource)

**IAM policy for a service account**
When managing IAM roles, you can treat a service account either as a resource or as an identity. This resource is used to add IAM policy bindings to a service account resource to configure permissions that define who can edit the service account.

There are three different resources that help you manage your IAM policy for a service account. Each of these resources is used for a different use case:
* [yandex_iam_service_account_iam_policy](iam_service_account_iam_policy.html): Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the service account and replaces any existing policy already attached.
* [yandex_iam_service_account_iam_binding](iam_service_account_iam_binding.html): Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the service account are preserved.
* [yandex_iam_service_account_iam_member](iam_service_account_iam_member.html): Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role of the service account are preserved.

~> `yandex_iam_service_account_iam_policy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `yandex_iam_service_account_iam_binding` and `yandex_iam_service_account_iam_member` or they will conflict over what your policy should be.

~> `yandex_iam_service_account_iam_binding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `yandex_iam_service_account_iam_member` resources **only if** they do not grant privileges to the same role.

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new IAM Service Account IAM Binding.
//
resource "yandex_iam_service_account_iam_binding" "admin-account-iam" {
  service_account_id = "aje5a**********qspd3"
  role               = "admin"

  members = [
    "userAccount:foo_user_id",
  ]
}
```

## Import

The resource can be imported by using their `resource ID`. For getting the resource ID you can use Yandex Cloud [Web Console](https://console.yandex.cloud) or [YC CLI](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cli/quickstart).

Service Account IAM binding resource can be imported using the service account ID and resource role.

```shell
# terraform import yandex_iam_service_account_iam_binding.<resource Name> "service_account_id roles/<resource Role>"
terraform import yandex_iam_service_account_iam_binding.admin-account-iam "aje5a**********qspd3 roles/admin"
```
