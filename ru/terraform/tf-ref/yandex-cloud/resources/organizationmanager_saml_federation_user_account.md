# yandex_organizationmanager_saml_federation_user_account (Resource)

Allows management of a single SAML Federation user account within an existing Yandex Cloud Organization.. For more information, see [the official documentation](https://yandex.cloud/docs/organization/operations/federations/integration-common).

~> If terraform user has sufficient access and user specified in data source does not exist, it will be created. This behaviour will be **deprecated** in future releases. Use resource `yandex_organizationmanager_saml_federation_user_account` to manage account lifecycle.

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new OrganizationManager SAML Federation User Account.
//
resource "yandex_organizationmanager_saml_federation_user_account" "account" {
  federation_id = "some_federation_id"
  name_id       = "example@example.org"
}
```
