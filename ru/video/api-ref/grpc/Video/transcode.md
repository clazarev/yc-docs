# Video API, gRPC: VideoService.Transcode

Initiates or updates video transcoding with specified parameters.
Can be used to start transcoding for videos with auto_transcode=DISABLE,
or to re-process a completed video with new transcoding settings.
Supports additional features like subtitle processing, translation, and summarization.

## gRPC request

**rpc Transcode ([TranscodeVideoRequest](#yandex.cloud.video.v1.TranscodeVideoRequest)) returns ([operation.Operation](#yandex.cloud.operation.Operation))**
